The IV catheter was inserted into the vein on the lower surface of the left forearm.  Venogram was performed, which demonstrated adequate appearance of the cephalic vein above the elbow.,Through a transverse incision, the cephalic vein and brachial artery were both exposed at the antecubital fossa.  The cephalic vein was divided, and the proximal end was anastomosed to the artery in an end-to-side fashion with a running 6-0 Prolene suture.,The clamps were removed establishing flow through the fistula.  Hemostasis was obtained.  The wound was closed in layers with PDS sutures.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition."
"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Congenital myotonic muscular dystrophy with bilateral planovalgus feet.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Congenital myotonic muscular dystrophy with bilateral planovalgus feet.,PROCEDURE: , Bilateral Crawford subtalar arthrodesis with open Achilles Z-lengthening and bilateral long-leg cast.,ANESTHESIA: , Surgery performed under general anesthesia.  The patient received 6 mL of 0.25% Marcaine local anesthetic on each side.,TOURNIQUET TIME:  ,Tourniquet time was 53 minutes on the left and 45 minutes on the right.,COMPLICATIONS: , There were no intraoperative complications.,DRAINS:,  None.,SPECIMENS: , None.,HARDWARE USED: , Staple 7/8 inch x1 on each side.,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  ,The patient is a 5-year-4-month-old male who presents for evaluation of feet.  He has been having significant feet pain with significant planovalgus deformity.  The patient was noted to have flexible vertical talus.  It was decided that the patient would benefit by subtalar arthrodesis, possible autograft, and Achilles lengthening.  This was explained to the mother in detail.  This is going to be a stabilizing measure and the patient will probably need additional surgery at a later day when his foot is more mature.  Risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for other surgical procedures, need to be nonweightbearing for some time.  All questions were answered and the mother agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE NOTE: , The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine on the operating room, general anesthesia was administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  Bilateral nonsterile tourniquets were placed on each thigh.  A bump was placed underneath the left buttock.  Both the extremities were then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  Attention was first turned towards the left side.  Intended incision was marked on the skin.  The ankle was taken through a range of motion with noted improvement in the reduction of the talocalcaneal alignment with the foot in plantar flexion on the lateral view.  The foot was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 200 mmHg.  Incision was then made over the left lateral aspect of the hind foot to expose the talocalcaneal joint.  The sinus tarsi was then identified using a U-shaped flap to tack muscles, and periosteum was retracted distally.  Once the foot was reduced a Steinman pin was used to hold it in position.  This position was first checked on the fluoroscopy.  The 7/8th inch staple was then placed across the sinus tarsi to maintain the reduction.  This was also checked with fluoroscopy.  The incision was then extended posteriorly to allow for visualization of the Achilles, which was Z-lengthened with the release of the lateral distal half.  This was sutured using 2-0 Ethibond and that was also oversewn.  The wound was irrigated with normal saline.  The periosteal flap was sutured over the staple using 2-0 Vicryl.  Skin was closed using 2-0 Vicryl interrupted and then with 4-0 Monocryl.  The area was injected with 6 mL of 0.25% Marcaine local anesthetic.  The wound was cleaned and dried, dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x 4s and Webril.  Tourniquet was released after 53 minutes.  The exact same procedure was repeated on the right side with no changes or complications.  Tourniquet time on the right side was 45 minutes.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Bilateral long-leg casts were then placed with the foot in neutral with some moulding of his medial plantar arch.  The patient was subsequently was taken to Recovery in stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The patient will be hospitalized overnight for pain as per parents' request.  The patient is to be strict nonweightbearing for at least 6 weeks.  He is to follow up in the next 10 days for a check.  We will plan of changing to short-leg casts in about 4 weeks postop."
"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Maxillary atrophy.,2.  Severe mandibular atrophy.,3.  Acquired facial deformity.,4.  Masticatory dysfunction.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Maxillary atrophy.,2.  Severe mandibular atrophy.,3.  Acquired facial deformity.,4.  Masticatory dysfunction.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Autologous iliac crest bone graft to maxilla and mandible under general anesthetic.,Dr. X and company accompanied the patient to OR #6 at 7:30 a.m.  Nasal trachea intubation was performed per routine.  The bilateral iliac crest harvest was first performed by Dr. X and company under separate OR report.  Once the bone was harvested, surgical templets were used to recontour initially the maxillary graft and the mandibular graft.  Then, CAT scan models were used to find tune and adjust the bony contact regions for the maxillary tricortical block graft and the mandibular tricortical block graft.  Subsequent to the harvest of the bilateral ilium, the intraoral region was scrubbed per routine.  Surgical team scrubbed and gowned in usual fashion and the patient was draped.  Xylocaine 1%, 1:100,000 epinephrine 7 ml was infiltrated into the labial and palatal mucosa.  A primary incision was made in the maxilla starting on the patient's left tuberosity region along the crest of the residual ridge to the contralateral side in similar fashion.  Release incisions were made in the posterior region of the maxilla.,A full-thickness periosteal reflexion first exposed the palatal region.  The contents of the neurovascular canal from the greater palatine foramina were identified.  The hard palate was directly observed.  The facial tissues were then reflected exposing the lateral aspect of the maxilla, the zygomatic arch, the infraorbital nerve, artery and vein, the lateral piriform rim, the inferior piriform rim, and the remaining issue of the nasal spine.  Similar features were reflected on the contralateral side.  The area was re-contoured with rongeurs.  The block of bone, which was formed and harvested from the left ilium was then placed and found to be stable.  A surgical mallet then compressed this bone further into the region.  A series of five 2 mm diameter titanium screws measuring 14 mm to 16 mm long were then used to fixate the block of bone into the residual maxilla.  Particulate bone was then placed around the remaining block of bone.  A piece of AlloDerm mixed with Croften and patient's platelet-rich plasma, which was centrifuged from drawing 20 cc of blood was then mixed together and placed over the lateral aspect of the block.  The tissues were expanded then with a tissue Metzenbaum scissors and once the labial tissue was expanded, the tissues were approximated for primary closure without tension using interrupted and continuous sutures #3-0 Gore-Tex.  Attention was brought then to the mandible.  1% Xylocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated in the labial mucosa 5 cc were given.  A primary incision was made between the mental foramina and the residual crest of the ridge and reflected first to the lingual area observing the superior genial tubercle in the facial area degloving the mentalis muscle and exposing the anterior body.  The anterior body was found to be approximately 3 mm in height.  A posterior tunnel was done first on the left side along the mylohyoid ridge and then under retromolar pad to the external oblique and the ridge was then degloved.  A tunnel was formed in the posterior region separating the mental nerve artery and vein from the flap and exposing that aspect of the body of the mandible.  A similar procedure was done on the contralateral side.  The tissues were stretched with tissue scissors and then a high speed instrumentation was used to decorticate the anterior mandible using a 1.6 mm twist drill and a pear shaped bur was used in the posterior region to begin original exploratory phenomenon of repair.  A block of bone was inserted between the mental foramina and fixative with three 16 cm screws first with a twist drill then followed with self-tapping 2 mm diameter titanium screws.  The block of bone was further re-contoured in situ.  Particulate bone was then injected into the posterior tunnels bilaterally.  A piece of AlloDerm was placed over those particulate segments.  The tissues were approximated for primary closure using #3-0 Gore-Tex suture both interrupted and horizontal mattress in form.  The tissues were compressed for about four minutes to allow platelet clots to form and to help adhere the flap.,The estimated blood loss in the harvest of the hip was 100 cc.  The estimated blood loss in the intraoral procedure was 220 cc.  Total blood loss for the procedure 320 cc.  The fluid administered 300 cc.  The urine out 180.  All sponges were counted encountered for as were sutures.  The patient was taken to Recovery at approximately 12 o'clock noon."
