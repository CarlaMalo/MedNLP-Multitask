In short, she is a 33-year-old lady with a BMI of 43, otherwise healthy with unsuccessful nonsurgical methods of weight loss. ,She was on laparoscopic gastric bypass for weight loss. ,She meets the National Institute of Health Criteria.  She is very well educated and motivated and has no major medical contraindications for the procedure.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  On physical examination today, she weighs 216 pounds with a BMI of 43.5, pulse is 96, temperature is 97.6, blood pressure is 122/80.  Lungs are clear.  Abdomen is soft, nontender.  There is stigmata for morbid obesity.  She has cesarean section scars in the lower abdomen with no herniation. ,DISCUSSION: , I had a long talk with the patient about laparoscopic gastric bypass, possible open including risks, benefits, alternatives, need for long-term followup, need to adhere to dietary and exercise guidelines.  I also explained to her complications including rare cases of death secondary to DVT, PE, leak , peritonitis, sepsis, shock, multisystem organ failure, need for re-operation including for leak or bleeding, gastrostomy or jejunostomy for feeding, rare case of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, etc., with myocardial infarction, pneumonia, atelectasis in the postoperative period were also discussed. ,Short-term complications of gastric bypass including gastrojejunal stricture requiring endoscopic dilatation, marginal ulcer secondary to smoking or anti-inflammatory drug intake which can progress on to perforation or bleeding, small bowel obstruction secondary to internal hernia or adhesions, signs and symptoms of which were discussed.  The patient would alert us for earlier intervention.  Symptomatic gallstone formation secondary to rapid weight loss were also discussed.  How to avoid it by taking ursodiol were also discussed.  Long-term complications of gastric bypass including hair loss, excess skin, multivitamin and mineral deficiencies, protein-calorie malnutrition, weight regain, weight plateauing, need for major lifestyle and exercise and habit changes, avoiding pregnancy in the first two years, etc., were all stressed.  The patient understands.  She wants to go to surgery. ,In preparation of surgery, she will undergo very low-calorie diet through Medifast to decrease the size of the liver to make laparoscopic approach more successful and also to optimize her cardiopulmonary and metabolic comorbidities.  She will also see a psychologist, nutritionist, and exercise physiologist for a multidisciplinary effort for short and long-term success for weight loss surgery.  I will see her two weeks before the plan of surgery for further discussion and any other questions at that point of time.",

She has tried many different diets, but is unsuccessful.  She has been to our Bariatric Surgery Seminar, received some handouts, and signed the consent.  The risks and benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  All pressure points were carefully padded.  She was given general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.  SCD stockings were placed on both legs.  Foley catheter was placed for bladder decompression.  The abdomen was then prepped and draped in standard sterile surgical fashion.  Marcaine was then injected through umbilicus.  A small incision was made.  A Veress needle was introduced into the abdomen.  CO2 insufflation was done to a maximum pressure of 15 mmHg.  A 12-mm VersaStep port was placed through the umbilicus.  I then placed a 5-mm port just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal on the right side.  I placed another 5-mm port in the midclavicular line just subcostal on the right side, a few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 12-mm VersaStep port.  On the left side, just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal, I placed a 5-mm port.  A few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 15-mm port.  I began by lifting up the omentum and identifying the transverse colon and lifting that up and thereby identifying my ligament of Treitz.  I ran the small bowel down approximately 40 cm and divided the small bowel with a white load GIA stapler.  I then divided the mesentery all the way down to the base of the mesentery with a LigaSure device.  I then ran the distal bowel down, approximately 100 cm, and at 100 cm, I made a hole at the antimesenteric portion of the Roux limb and a hole in the antimesenteric portion of the duodenogastric limb, and I passed a 45 white load stapler and fired a stapler creating a side-to-side anastomosis.  I reapproximated the edges of the defect.  I lifted it up and stapled across it with another white load stapler.  I then closed the mesenteric defect with interrupted Surgidac sutures.  I divided the omentum all the way down to the colon in order to create a passageway for my small bowel to go antecolic.  I then put the patient in reverse Trendelenburg.  I placed a liver retractor, identified, and dissected the angle of His.  I then dissected on the lesser curve, approximately 2.5 cm below the gastroesophageal junction, and got into a lesser space.  I fired transversely across the stomach with a 45 blue load stapler.  I then used two fires of the 60 blue load with SeamGuard to go up into my angle of His, thereby creating my gastric pouch.  I then made a hole at the base of the gastric pouch and had Anesthesia remove the bougie and place the OG tube connected to the anvil.  I pulled the anvil into place, and I then opened up my 15-mm port site and passed my EEA stapler.  I passed that in the end of my Roux limb and had the spike come out antimesenteric.  I joined the spike with the anvil and fired a stapler creating an end-to-side anastomosis, then divided across the redundant portion of my Roux limb with a white load GI stapler, and removed it with an Endocatch bag.  I put some additional 2-0 Vicryl sutures in the anastomosis for further security.  I then placed a bowel clamp across the bowel.  I went above and passed an EGD scope into the mouth down to the esophagus and into the gastric pouch.  I distended gastric pouch with air.  There was no air leak seen.  I could pass the scope easily through the anastomosis.  There was no bleeding seen through the scope.  We closed the 15-mm port site with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture utilizing Carter-Thomason.  I copiously irrigated out that incision with about 2 L of saline.  I then closed the skin of all incisions with running Monocryl.  Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.",

Patient was placed in the thoracoabdominal position with the left chest up and the hips back to a 30-degree angle.  The left groin, abdominal and chest were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A thoracoabdominal incision was made.  The 8th interspace was entered.  The costal margin was divided.  The retroperitoneal space was entered and bluntly dissected free to the psoas, bringing all the peritoneal contents to the midline, exposing the aorta.  The inferior pulmonary ligament was then taken down so the aorta could be dissected free at the T10 level just above the diaphragm.  It was dissected free circumferentially.  The aortic bifurcation was dissected free, dissecting free both iliac arteries.  The left inferior pulmonary vein was then dissected free, and a pursestring of 4-0 Prolene was placed on this.  The patient was heparinized.  Through a stab wound in the center of this, a right-angle venous cannula was then placed at the left atrium and secured to a Rumel tourniquet.  This was hooked to a venous inflow of left heart bypass machine.  A pursestring of 4-0 Prolene was placed on the aneurysm and through a stab wound in the center of this, an arterial cannula was placed and hooked to outflow.  Bypass was instituted.  The aneurysm was cross clamped just above T10 and also, cross clamped just below the diaphragm.  The area was divided at this point.  A 26-mm graft was then sutured in place with running 3-0 Prolene suture.  The graft was brought into the diaphragm.  Clamps were then placed on the iliacs, and the pump was shut off.  The aorta was opened longitudinally, going posterior between the left and right renal arteries, and it was completely transected at its bifurcation.  The SMA, celiac and right renal artery were then dissected free as a complete island, and the left renal was dissected free as a complete Carrell patch.  The island was laid in the graft for the visceral liner, and it was sutured in place with running 4-0 Prolene suture with pledgetted 4-0 Prolene sutures around the circumference.  The clamp was then moved below the visceral vessels, and the clamp on the chest was removed, re-establishing flow to the visceral vessels.  The graft was cut to fit the bifurcation and sutured in place with running 3-0 Prolene suture.  All clamps were removed, and flow was re-established.  An 8-mm graft was sutured end-to-end to the Carrell patch and to the left renal.  A partial-occlusion clamp was placed.  An area of graft was removed.  The end of the graft was cut to fit this and sutured in place with running Prolene suture.  The partial-occlusion clamp was removed.  Protamine was given.  Good hemostasis was noted.  The arterial cannula, of course, had been removed when that part of the aneurysm was removed.  The venous cannula was removed and oversewn with a 4-0 Prolene suture.  Good hemostasis was noted.  A 36 French posterior and a 32 French anterior chest tube were placed.  The ribs were closed with figure-of-eight #2 Vicryl.

      "text": "HISTORY OF INJURY AND PRESENT COMPLAINTS: , The patient is a 59-year-old gentleman.  He is complaining chiefly of persistent lower back pain.  He states the pain is of a rather constant nature.  He describes it as a rather constant dull ache, sometimes rather sharp and stabbing in nature, most localized to the right side of his back more so than the left side of his lower back.  He states he has difficulty with prolonged standing or sitting.  He can only stand for about 5-10 minutes, then he has to sit down.  He can only sit for about 15-20 minutes, he has to get up and move about because it exacerbates his back pain.  He has difficulty with bending and stooping maneuvers.  He describes an intermittent radiating pain down his right leg, down from the right gluteal hip area to the back of the thigh to the calf and the foot.  He gets numbness along the lateral aspect of the foot itself.  He also describes chronic pain complaints with associated tension in the back of his neck.  He states the pain is of a constant nature in his neck.  He states he gets pain that radiates into the right shoulder girdle area and the right forearm.  He describes some numbness along the lateral aspect of the right forearm.  He states he has trouble trying to use his arm at or above shoulder height.  He has difficulty pushing, pulling, gripping, and grasping with the right upper extremity.  He describes pain at the anterior aspect of his shoulder, in particular.  He denies any headache complaints.  He is relating his above complaints to two industrial injuries that he sustained while employed with Frito Lay Company as a truck driver or delivery person.  He relates an initial injury that occurred on 06/29/1994, when apparently he was stepping out of the cab of his truck.  He lost his footing and fell.  He reached out to grab the hand railing.  He fell backwards on his back and his right shoulder.  He had immediate onset of shoulder pain, neck pain, and low back pain.  He had pain into his right leg.  He initially came under the care of Dr. H, an occupational physician in Modesto.  Initially, he did not obtain any MRIs or x-rays.  He did undergo some physical therapy and received some medications.  Dr. H referred him to Dr. Q, a chiropractor for three visits, which the patient was not certain was very helpful.  The patient advises he then changed treating physicians to Dr. N, D.C., whom he had seen previously for some back pain complaints back in 1990.  He felt that the chiropractic care was helping his back, neck, and shoulder pain complaints somewhat.  He continues with rather persistent pain in his right shoulder.  He underwent an MRI of the right shoulder performed on 08/16/1994 which revealed prominent impingement with biceps tenosynovitis as well as supraspinatus tendonitis superimposed by a small pinhole tear of the rotator cuff.  The patient was referred to Dr. P, an orthopedic surgeon who suggested some physical therapy for him and some antiinflammatories.  He felt that the patient might require a cortisone injection or possibly a surgical intervention.  The patient also underwent an MRI of the cervical spine on 08/03/1994, which again revealed multilevel degenerative disc disease in his neck.  There is some suggestion of bilateral neuroforaminal encroachment due to degenerative changes and disc bulges, particularly at C5-6 and C6-7 levels.  The patient was also seen by Dr. P, a neurologist for a Neurology consult.  It is unclear to me as to whether or not Dr. P had performed an EMG or nerve conduction studies of his upper or lower extremities.  The patient was off work for approximately six months following his initial injury date that occurred on 06/29/1994.  He returned back to regular duty.  Dr. N declared him permanent and stationary on 04/04/1995.  The patient then had a recurrence or flare-up or possibly new injury, again, particularly to his lower back while working for Frito Lay on 03/29/1997, when he was loading some pallets on the back of a trailer.  At that time, he returned to see Dr. N for chiropractic care, who is his primary treating physician.  Dr. N took him off work again.  He was off work again for approximately another six months, during which time, he was seen by Dr. M, M.D., a neurosurgeon.  He had a new MRI of his lumbar spine performed.  The MRI was performed on 05/20/1997.  It revealed L4-5 disc space narrowing with prominent disc bulge with some mild spinal stenosis.  The radiologist had noted he had a prior disc herniation at this level with some improvement from prior exam.  Dr. M saw him on 09/18/1997 and noted that there was some improvement in his disc herniation at the L4-5 level following a more recent MRI exam of 05/20/1997, from previous MRI exam of 1996 which revealed a rather prominent right-sided L4-5 disc herniation.  Dr. M felt that there was no indication for a lumbar spine surgery, but he mentioned with regards to his cervical spine, he felt that EMG studies of the right upper extremity should be obtained and he may require a repeat MRI of the cervical spine, if the study was positive.  The patient did undergo some nerve conduction studies of his lower extremities with Dr. K, M.D., which suggested a possible abnormal EMG with evidence of possible L5 radiculopathy, both right and left.  Unfortunately, I had no medical reports from Dr. P suggesting that he may have performed nerve conduction studies or EMGs of the upper and lower extremities.  The patient did see Dr. R for a neurosurgical consult.  Dr. R evaluated both his neck and lower back pain complaints on several occasions.  Dr. R suggested that the patient try some cervical epidural steroid injections and lumbar selective nerve root blocks.  The patient underwent these injections with Dr. K.  The patient reported only very slight relief temporarily with regards to his back and leg symptoms following the injections.  It is not clear from the medical record review whether the patient ever had a cervical epidural steroid injection; it appears that he had some selective nerve root blocks performed in the lumbar spine.  Dr. R on 12/15/2004 suggested that the patient had an MRI of the cervical spine revealing a right-sided C5-6 herniated nucleus pulposus which would explain his C-6 distribution numbness.  The patient also was noted to have a C4-5 with rather severe degenerative disc disease.  He felt the patient might be a candidate for a two-level ACDF at C4-5 and C5-6.  Dr. R in another report of 08/11/2004 suggested that the patient's MRI of 05/25/2004 of the lumbar spine reveals multilevel degenerative disc disease.  He had an L4-5 slight anterior spondylolisthesis, this may be a transitional vertebrae at the L6 level as well, with lumbarization of S1.  He felt that his examination suggested a possible right S1 radiculopathy with discogenic back pain.  He would suggest right-sided S1 selective nerve root blocks to see if this would be helpful; if not, he might be a candidate for a lumbar spine fusion, possibly a Dynesys or a fusion or some major spine surgery to help resolve his situation., ,The patient relates that he really prefers a more conservative approach of treatment regarding his neck, back, and right shoulder symptoms.  He continued to elect chiropractic care which he has found helpful, but apparently the insurance carrier is no longer authorizing chiropractic care for him.  He is currently taking no medications to manage his pain complaints.  He states regarding his work status, he was off work again for another six months following the 03/29/1997 injury.  He returned back to work and continued to work regular duty up until about a year ago, at which time, he was taken back off work again and placed on TTD status by Dr. N, his primary treating physician.  The patient states he has not been back to work since.  He has since applied for social security disability and now is receiving social security disability benefits.  The patient states he has tried some Myox therapy with Dr. H on 10 sessions, which he found somewhat helpful.  Overall, the patient does not feel that he could return back to his usual and customary work capacity as a delivery driver for Frito Lay.,",

      "text": "DATE OF INJURY : October 4, 2000,DATE OF EXAMINATION : September 5, 2003,EXAMINING PHYSICIAN : X Y, MD,Prior to the beginning of the examination, it is explained to the examinee that this examination is intended for evaluative purposes only, and that it is not intended to constitute a general medical examination. It is explained to the examinee that the traditional doctor-patient relationship does not apply to this examination, and that a written report will be provided to the agency requesting this examination. It has also been emphasized to the examinee that he should not attempt any physical activity beyond his tolerance, in order to avoid injury.,CHIEF COMPLAINT:  ,Aching and mid back pain.,HISTORY OF PRESENT INJURY: , Based upon the examinee's perspective: ,Mr. Abc is a 52-year-old self-employed, independent consultant for DEMILEE-USA. He is also a mechanical engineer. He reports that he was injured in a motor vehicle accident that occurred in October 4, 2000. At that time, he was employed as a purchasing agent for IBIKEN-USA. On the date of the motor vehicle accident, he was sitting in the right front passenger's seat, wearing seat and shoulder belt safety harnesses, in his 1996 or 1997 Volvo 850 Wagon automobile driven by his son. The vehicle was completely stopped and was \"slammed from behind\" by a van. The police officer, who responded to the accident, told Mr. Abc that the van was probably traveling at approximately 30 miles per hour at the time of impact.,During the impact, Mr. Abc was restrained in the seat and did not contact the interior surface of the vehicle. He experienced immediate mid back pain. He states that the Volvo automobile sustained approximately $4600 in damage.,He was transported by an ambulance, secured by a cervical collar and backboard to the emergency department. An x-ray of the whole spine was obtained, and he was evaluated by a physician's assistant. He was told that it would be \"okay to walk.\" He was prescribed pain pills and told to return for reevaluation if he experienced increasing pain.,He returned to the Kaiser facility a few days later, and physical therapy was prescribed. Mr. Abc states that he was told that \"these things can take a long time.\" He indicates that after one year he was no better. He then states that after two years he was no better and worried if the condition would never get better.,He indicates he saw an independent physician, a general practitioner, and an MRI was ordered. The MRI study was completed at ABCD Hospital. Subsequently, Mr. Abc returned and was evaluated by a physiatrist. The physiatrist reexamined the original thoracic spine x-rays that were taken on October 4, 2000, and stated that he did not know why the radiologist did not originally observe vertebral compression fractures. Mr. Abc believes that he was told by the physiatrist that it involved either T6-T7 or T7-T8.,Mr. Abc reports that the physiatrist told him that little could be done besides participation in core strengthening. Mr. Abc describes his current exercise regimen, consisting of cycling, and it was deemed to be adequate. He was told, however, by the physiatrist that he could also try a Pilates type of core exercise program.,The physiatrist ordered a bone scan, and Mr. Abc is unsure of the results. He does not have a formal follow up scheduled with Kaiser, and is awaiting re-contact by the physiatrist.,He denies any previous history of symptomatology or injuries involving his back.,CURRENT SYMPTOMS:  ,He reports that he has the same mid back pain that has been present since the original injury. It is located in the same area, the mid thoracic spine area. It is described as a pain and an ache and ranges from 3/10 to 6/10 in intensity, and the intensity varies, seeming to go in cycles. The pain has been staying constant.,When I asked whether or not the pain have improved, he stated that he was unable to determine whether or not he had experienced improvement. He indicates that there may be less pain, or conversely, that he may have developed more of a tolerance for the pain. He further states that \"I can power through it.\" \"I have learned how to manage the pain, using exercise, stretching, and diversion techniques.\" It is primary limitation with regards to the back pain involves prolonged sitting. After approximately two hours of sitting, he has required to get up and move around, which results in diminishment of the pain. He indicates that prior to the motor vehicle accident, he could sit for significantly longer periods of time, 10 to 12 hours on a regular basis, and up to 20 hours, continuously, on an occasional basis.,He has never experienced radiation of the pain from the mid thoracic spine, and he has never experienced radicular symptoms of radiation of pain into the extremities, numbness, tingling, or weakness.,Again, aggravating activities include prolonged sitting, greater than approximately two hours.,Alleviating activities include moving around, stretching, and exercising. Also, if he takes ibuprofen, it does seem to help with the back pain.,He is not currently taking medications regularly, but list that he takes occasional ibuprofen when the pain is too persistent.,He indicates that he received several physical therapy sessions for treatment, and was instructed in stretching and exercises. He has subsequently performed the prescribed stretching and exercises daily, for nearly three years.,With regards to recreational activities, he states that he has not limited his activities due to his back pain.,He denies bowel or bladder dysfunction.,FILES REVIEW:  ,October 4, 2000: An ambulance was dispatched to the scene of a motor vehicle accident on South and Partlow Road. The EMS crew arrived to find a 49-year-old male sitting in the front passenger seat of a vehicle that was damaged in a rear-end collision and appeared to have minimal damage. He was wearing a seatbelt and he denied loss of consciousness. He also denied a pertinent past medical history. They noted pain in the lower cervical area, mid thoracic and lumbar area. They placed him on a backboard and transported him to Medical Center.,October 4, 2000: He was seen in the emergency department of Medical Center. The provider is described as \"unknown.\" The history from the patient was that he was the passenger in the front seat of a car that was stopped and rear-ended. He stated that he did not exit the car because of pain in his upper back. He reported he had been wearing the seatbelt and harness at that time. He denied a history of back or neck injuries. He was examined on a board and had a cervical collar in place. He was complaining of mid back pain. He denied extremity weakness. Sensory examination was intact. There was no tenderness with palpation or flexion in the neck. The back was a little tender in the upper thoracic spine area without visible deformity. There were no marks on the back. His x-ray was described as \"no acute bony process.\" Listed visit diagnosis was a sprain-thoracic, and he was prescribed hydrocodone/acetaminophen tablets and Motrin 800 mg tablets.,October 4, 2000: During the visit, a Clinician's Report of Disability document was signed by Dr. M, authorizing time loss from October 4, 2000, through October 8, 2000. The document also advised no heavy lifting, pushing, pulling, or overhead work for two weeks. During this visit, a thoracic spine x-ray series, two views, was obtained and read by Dr. JR. The findings demonstrate no evidence of acute injury. No notable arthritic findings. The pedicles and paravertebral soft tissues appear unremarkable.,November 21, 2000: An outpatient progress note was completed at Kaiser, and the clinician of record was Dr. H. The history obtained documents that Mr. Abc continued to experience the same pain that he first noted after the accident, described as a discomfort in the mid thoracic spine area. It was non-radiating and described as a tightness. He also reported that he was hearing clicking noises that he had not previously heard. He denied loss of strength in the arms. The physical examination revealed good strength and normal deep tendon reflexes in the arms. There was minimal tenderness over T4 through T8, in an approximate area. The visit diagnosis listed was back pain. Also described in the assessment was residual pain from MVA, suspected bruised muscles. He was prescribed Motrin 800 mg tablets and an order was sent to physical therapy. Dr. N also documents that if the prescribed treatment measures were not effective, then he would suggest a referral to a physiatrist. Also, the doctor wanted him to discuss with physical therapy whether or not they thought that a chiropractor would be beneficial.,December 4, 2000: He was seen at Kaiser for a physical therapy visit by Philippe Justel, physical therapist. The history obtained from Mr. Abc is that he was not improving. Symptoms described were located in the mid back, centrally. The examination revealed mild tenderness, centrally at T3-T8, with very poor segmental mobility. The posture was described as rigid T/S in flexion. Range of motion was described as within normal limits, without pain at the cervical spine and thoracic spine. The plan listed included two visits per week for two weeks, for mobilization. It is also noted that the physical therapist would contact the MD regarding a referral to a chiropractor.,December 8, 2000: He was seen at Kaiser for a physical therapy visit by Mr. Justel. It was noted that the subjective category of the document revealed that there was no real change. It was noted that Mr. Abc tolerated the treatment well and that he was to see a chiropractor on Monday.,December 11, 2000: He presented to the Chiropractic Wellness Center. There is a form titled 'Chiropractic Case History,' and it documents that Mr. Abc was involved in a motor vehicle accident, in which he was rear-ended in October. He has had mid back pain since that time. The pain is worsened with sitting, especially at a computer. The pain decreases when he changes positions, and sometimes when he walks. Mr. Abc reports that he occasionally takes 800 mg doses of ibuprofen. He reported he went to physical therapy treatment on two occasions, which helped for a few hours only. He did report that he had a previous history of transitory low back pain.,During the visit, he completed a modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, and a WC/PI Subjective Complaint Form. He listed complaints of mid and low back pain of a sore and aching character. He rated the pain at grade 3-5/10, in intensity. He reported difficulty with sitting at a table, bending forward, or stooping. He reported that the pain was moderate and comes and goes.,During the visit at the Chiropractic Wellness Center, a spinal examination form was completed. It documents palpation tenderness in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine area and also palpation tenderness present in the suboccipital area, scalenes, and trapezia. Active cervical range of motion measured with goniometry reveals pain and restriction in all planes. Active thoracic range of motion measured with inclinometry revealed pain and restriction in rotation bilaterally. Active lumbosacral range of motion measured with inclinometry reveals pain with lumbar extension, right lateral flexion, and left lateral flexion.,December 11, 2000: He received chiropractic manipulation treatment, and he was advised to return for further treatment at a frequency of twice a week.,December 13, 2000: He returned to the Chiropractic Wellness Center to see Joe Smith, DC, and it is documented that his middle back was better.,December 13, 2000: A personal injury patient history form is completed at the Chiropractic Wellness Center. Mr. Abc reported that on October 4, 2000, he was driving his 1996 Volvo 850 vehicle, wearing seat and shoulder belt safety harnesses, and completely stopped. He was rear-ended by a vehicle traveling at approximately 30 miles per hour. The impact threw him back into his seat, and he felt back pain and determined that it was not wise to move about. He reported approximate damage to his vehicle of $4800. He reported continuing mid and low back pain, of a dull and semi-intense nature. He reported that he was an export company manager for IBIKEN-USA, and that he missed two full days of work, and missed 10-plus partial days of work. He stated that he was treated initially after the motor vehicle accident at Kaiser and received painkillers and ibuprofen, which relieved the pain temporarily. He specifically denied ever experiencing similar symptoms.,December 26, 2000: A no-show was documented at the Chiropractic Wellness Center.,April 5, 2001: He received treatment at the Chiropractic Wellness Center. He reported that two weeks previously, his mid back pain had worsened.,April 12, 2001: He received chiropractic treatment at the Chiropractic Wellness Center.,April 16, 2001: He did not show up for his chiropractic treatment.,April 19, 2001: He did not show up for his chiropractic treatment.,April 26, 2001: He received chiropractic manipulation treatment at the Chiropractic Wellness Center. He reported that his mid back pain increased with sitting at the computer. At the conclusion of this visit, he was advised to return to the clinic as needed.,September 6, 2002: An MRI of the thoracic spine was completed at ABCD Hospital and read by Dr. RL, radiologist. Dr. D noted the presence of minor anterior compression of some mid thoracic vertebrae of indeterminate age, resulting in some increased kyphosis. Some of the mid thoracic discs demonstrate findings consistent with degenerative disc disease, without a significant posterior disc bulging or disc herniation. There are some vertebral end-plate abnormalities, consistent with small Schmorl's nodes, one on the superior aspect of T7, which is compressed anteriorly, and on the inferior aspect of T6.,May 12, 2003: He was seen at the Outpatient Clinic by Dr. L, internal medicine specialist. He was there for a health screening examination, and listed that his only complaints are for psoriasis and chronic mid back pain, which have been present since a 2000 motor vehicle accident. Mr. Abc reported that an outside MRI showed compression fractures in the thoracic spine. The history further documents that Mr. Abc is an avid skier and volunteers on the ski patrol. The physical examination revealed that he was a middle-aged Caucasian male in no acute distress. The diagnosis listed from this visit is back pain and psoriasis. Dr. L documented that he spent one hour in the examination room with the patient discussing what was realistic and reasonable with regard to screening testing. Dr. L also stated that since Mr. Abc was experiencing chronic back pain, he advised him to see a physiatrist for evaluation. He was instructed to bring the MRI to the visit with that practitioner.,June 10, 2003: He was seen at the Physiatry Clinic by Dr. R, physiatrist. The complaint listed is mid back pain. In the subjective portion of the chart note, Dr. R notes that Mr. Abc is involved in the import/export business, and that he is physically active in cycling, skiing, and gardening. He is referred by Dr. L because of persistent lower thoracic pain, following a motor vehicle accident, on October 4, 2000. Mr. Abc told Dr. R that he was the restrained passenger of a vehicle that was rear-ended at a moderate speed. He stated that he experienced immediate discomfort in his thoracic spine area without radiation. He further stated that thoracic spine x-rays were obtained at the Sunnyside Emergency Room and read as normal. It is noted that Mr. Abc was treated conservatively and then referred to physical therapy where he had a number of visits in late of 2002 and early 2003. No further chart entries were documented about the back problem until Mr. Abc complained to Dr. L that he still had ongoing thoracic spine pain during a visit the previous month. He obtained an MRI, out of pocket, at ABCD Hospital and stated that he paid $1100 for it. Dr. R asked to see the MRI and was told by Mr. Abc that he would have to reimburse or pay him $1100 first. He then told the doctor that the interpretation was that he had a T7 and T8 compression fracture. Mr. Abc reported his improvement at about 20%, compared to how he felt immediately after the accident. He described that his only symptoms are an aching pain that occurs after sitting for four to five hours. If he takes a break from sitting and walks around, his symptoms resolve. He is noted to be able to bike, ski, and be active in his garden without any symptoms at all. He denied upper extremity radicular symptoms. He denied lower extremity weakness or discoordination. He also denied bowel or bladder control or sensation issues. Dr. R noted that Mr. Abc was hostile about the Kaiser health plan and was quite uncommunicative, only reluctantly revealing his history. The physical examination revealed that he moved about the examination room without difficulty and exhibited normal lumbosacral range of motion. There was normal thoracic spine motion with good chest expansion. Neurovascular examination of the upper extremities was recorded as normal. There was no spasticity in the lower extremities. There was no tenderness to palpation or percussion up and down the thoracic spine. Dr. R reviewed the thoracic spine films and noted the presence of \"a little compression of what appears to be T7 and T8 on the lateral view.\" Dr. R observed that this was not noted on the original x-ray interpretation. He further stated that the MRI, as noted above, was not available for review. Dr. R assessed that Mr. Abc was experiencing minimal thoracic spine complaints that probably related to the motor vehicle accident three years previously. The doctor further stated that \"the patient's symptoms are so mild as to almost not warrant intervention.\" He discussed the need to make sure that Mr. Abc's workstation was ergonomic and that Mr. Abc could pursue core strengthening. He further recommended that Mr. Abc look into participation in a Pilates class. Mr. Abc was insistent, so Dr. R made plans to order a bone scan to further discriminate the etiology of his symptoms. He advised Mr. Abc that the bone scan results would probably not change treatment. As a result of this visit, Dr. R diagnosed thoracic spine pain (724.1) and ordered a bone scan study.",

The patient is status post resection of the dorsal nasal sidewall skin cancer with nasolabial flap reconstruction with subsequent deformity.  In particular, the patient has had effacement of his alar crease with deepening of his nasolabial fold and notable asymmetry.  The patient was seen in consultation and felt to be a surgical candidate for improvement.  Risks and benefits of the operation were described to the patient in detail including, but not limited to bleeding, infection, scarring, possible damage to surrounding structures including neurovascular structures, need for revision of surgery, continued asymmetry, and anesthetic complication.  The patient understood these risks and benefits and consented to the operation.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to OR and placed supine on the operating table.  Dose of antibiotics was given to the patient.  Compression devices were placed on the lower extremities to prevent the knee embolic events.  The patient was turned to 180 degrees.  The ETT tube was secured and the area was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A head wrap was then placed on the position and we then began our local.  Of note, the patient had previous incisions just lateral to his lateral canthus bilaterally and that were used for access.  Local consisting a 50:50 mix of 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was then injected into the subperiosteal plane taking care to prevent injury to the infraorbital nerves.  This was done bilaterally.  We then marked the nasolabial fold and began with the elevation of the left midface.,We began with a lateral canthal-type incision extending out over his previous incision down to subcutaneous tissue.  We continued down to the lateral orbital rim until we identified periosteum.  We then pulled in a periosteal elevator and elevated the midface down over the zygoma elevating some lateral mesenteric attachments down over the buccal region until we felt we had reached pass the nasolabial folds medially.  Care was taken to preserve the infraorbital nerve and that was visualized after elevation.  We then released the periosteum distally and retracted up on the periosteum and noted improved contour of the nasolabial fold with increased bulk over the midface region over the zygoma.,We then used our Endotine Coapt device to engage the periosteum at the desired location and then elevated the midface and secured into position using the Coapt bioabsorbable screw.  After this was then carried out, we then clipped and cut as well as the end of the screw.  Satisfied with this, we then elevated the periosteum and secured it to reinforce our midface elevation to the lateral orbital rim and this was done using 3-0 Monocryl.  Several sutures were then used to anchor the orbicularis and deeper tissue to create additional symmetry.  Excess skin along the incision was then removed as well the skin from just lateral to the canthus.  Care was taken to leave the orbicularis muscle down.  We then continued closing our incision using absorbable plain gut 5-0 sutures for the subciliary-type incision and then continuing with interrupted 6-0 Prolenes lateral to the canthus.,We then turned our attention to performing the z-plasty portion of the case.  A z-plasty was designed along the previous scar where it was padding to the notable scar deformity and effacement of crease and the z-plasty was then designed to lengthen along the scar to improve the contour.  This was carried out using a 15 blade down to subcutaneous tissue.  The flaps were debulked slightly to reduce the amount of fullness and then transposed and sutured into place using chromic suture.  At this point, we then noted that he had improvement of the nasal fold but continued asymmetry with regards to improved bulk on the left side and less bulk on the right and it was felt that a symmetrization procedure was required to make more symmetry with the midface bilaterally and nasolabial folds bilaterally.  As such, we then carried out the dissection after injecting local as noted and we used a 15 blade scalpel to create our incision along the lateral canthus along its preexisting incision.  We carried this down to the lateral orbital rim again elevating the periosteum taking care to preserve infraorbital nerve.,At this point, we then released the periosteum distally just at the level of the nasolabial fold and placed our Endotine midface implant into the desired area and then elevated slightly just for symmetry only.  This was then secured in place using the bioabsorbable screw and then resected a very marginal amount of tissue just for removal of the dog ear deformity and closed the deeper layers of tissue using 3-0 PDS and then closing the extension to the subciliary area using 5-0 plain gut and then 6-0 Prolene lateral to the canthus.,At this point, we felt that we had achieved improved contour, improved symmetry, and decreased effacement of the nasolabial fold and alar crease.  Satisfied with our procedures, we then placed cool compresses on to the eyes.,The patient was then extubated and brought to the PACU in stable condition.,Dr. X was present and scrubbed for the entire case and actively participated during all key elements.

The patient had asymmetry as well as right breast hypertrophy, and therefore, the procedures named above were indicated.  The patient was informed about the possible risks and complications of the above procedures and gave an informed consent.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operating room, placed supine on the operative table.  After adequate endotracheal anesthesia was established and IV prophylactic antibiotics were given, the chest and abdomen were prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.,Attention was first turned to the left breast where liposuction was performed laterally to allow for better contour and minimize the outer quadrant.  The incision was made for this and was then closed with 5-0 Prolene interrupted suture.,Attention was then turned to the right breast where liposuction was also performed to reduce the medial superior and lateral quadrants.  Once this was performed, the vertical reduction mammoplasty was outlined.  Prior to that, the nipple reconstruction was performed with a keyhole pattern flap.  The flap was elevated with 15-blade and hemostasis was then obtained with the Bovie.  The flap was then sutured onto itself and secured with 5-0 Prolene interrupted sutures.  Then the lateral and medial limbs were undermined to close the defect and this was performed with 3-0 Monocryl interrupted sutures.  Subsequently, the reduction mastectomy skin was then excised sharply and passed up the table marked and sent to Pathology. ,Hemostasis was then obtained with the Bovie and then undermining was performed in the medial, superior, and lateral skin to allow for closure of the reduction incisions.  Once this was performed, a 3-0 Monocryl interrupted sutures were used to close the inferior limb.  Subsequently 2-0 PDS continuous suture was then placed in the periareolar area to close the defect, with a diameter that equaled the new nipple areolar complex.  Once this was performed, the remaining incision was then closed with 3-0 Monocryl followed by 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures.  Subsequently, the 2 lesions were excised, the larger one which was medial and the lateral one that was smaller that were excised sharply, passed up the table and sent to Pathology.  They were closed in 2 layers using 3-0 Monocryl followed by 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular suture.,Attention was then turned to the abdominal scars where liposuction and tumescent solution of diluted epinephrine were used to minimize the amount of excision that was required.  Subsequently the extra skin was excised sharply in an elliptical fashion on the right side measuring approximately 10 x 3 cm, this was the superior and inferior skin, was when undermined and closure was performed after hemostasis was obtained with 3-0 Monocryl followed by 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular suture.,Attention was then turned to the contralateral left side where there was a larger defect.  There was a larger excision required measuring approximately 15 x 3 cm.  The superior and inferior edges of skin were undermined and closed primarily using 3-0 Monocryl followed by 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures.  Steri-Strips were placed on all incisions followed by surgical bra.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated without complications and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.

Right breast was slightly larger than the left this was repaired with a basic wise pattern reduction mammoplasty with anterior pedicle.,PROCEDURE,With the patient under satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia, the entire chest was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A previously placed mark to identify the neo-nipple site was re-identified and carefully measured for asymmetry and appeared to be satisfactory.  A keyhole wire ring was then used to outline the basic wise pattern with 6-cm lamps inferiorly.  This was then carefully checked for symmetry and appeared to be satisfactory.  All marks were then completed and lightly incised on both breasts.  The right breast was approached first.  The neo-nipple site was de-epithelialized superiorly and then the inferior pedicle was de-epithelialized using cutting cautery.  After this had been completed, cutting cautery was used to carry down an incision along the inferior aspect of the periosteum starting immediately.  This was taken down to the prepectoral fashion dissected for short distance superiorly, and then blunt dissection was used to mobilize under the superior portion of the breast tissues to the lateral edge of the pectoral muscle.  There was very little bleeding with this procedure.  After this had been completed, attention was directed to the lateral side, and the inferior incision was made and taken down to the serratus.  Cautery dissection was then used to carry this up superiorly over the lateral edge of the pectoral muscle to communicate with the previous pocket.  After this had been completed, cutting cautery was used to cut around the inferior pedicle completely freeing the superior breast from the inferior breast.  Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  After this had been completed, cutting cautery was used to cut along the superior edge of the redundant tissue and this was tapered under the superior flaps.  On the right side, there was a small palpable lobule, which had shown up on mammogram, but nothing except some fat density was identified.  This site had been previously marked carefully, and there were no unusual findings and the superior tissue was then sent out separately for pathology.  After this had been completed, final hemostasis obtained, and the wound was irrigated and a tagging suture placed to approximate the tissues.  The breast cleared and the nipple appeared good.,Attention was then directed to the left breast, which was completed in the similar manner.  After this had been completed, the patient was placed in a near upright position, and symmetry appeared good, but it was a bit poor on the lateral aspect of the right side, which was little larger and some suction lipectomy was carried out in this area.  After completion of this, 1860 grams had been removed from the right and 1505 grams was removed from the left.  Through separate stab wounds on the lateral aspect, 10-mm flat Blake drains were brought out and sutures were then placed **** and irrigated.  The wounds were then closed with interrupted 4-0 Monocryl on the deep dermis and running intradermal 4-0 Monocryl on the skin, packing sutures and staples were removed as they were approached.  The nipple was sutured with running intradermal 4-0 Monocryl.  Vascularity appeared good throughout.  After this had been completed, all wounds were cleaned and Steri-Stripped.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  All counts were correct.  Estimated blood loss was less than 150 mL, and she was sent to recovery room in good condition.",

Transconjunctival lower lid blepharoplasty with removal of a portion of the medial and middle fat pad.,ANESTHESIA: , General via endotracheal tube.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: , The patient is a 28-year-old country and western performer who was involved in a motor vehicle accident over a year ago.  Since that time, she is felt to have facial asymmetry, which is apparent in publicity photographs for her record promotions.  She had requested a procedure to bring about further facial asymmetry.  She was seen preoperatively by psychiatrist specializing in body dysmorphic disorder as well as analysis of the patient's requesting cosmetic surgery and was felt to be a psychiatrically good candidate.  She did have facial asymmetry with the bit of more fullness in higher cheekbone on the right as compared to the left.  Preoperative workup including CT scan failed to show any skeletal trauma.  The patient was counseled with regard to the risks, benefits, alternatives, and complications of the postsurgical procedure including but not limited to bleeding, infection, unacceptable cosmetic appearance, numbness of the face, change in sensation of the face, facial nerve paralysis, need for further surgery, need for revision, hair loss, etc., and informed consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position after having been marked in the upright position while awake.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced with a #6 endotracheal tube.  All appropriate measures were taken to preserve the vocal cords in a professional singer.  Local anesthesia consisting of 5/6th 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 units of epinephrine in 1/6th 0.25% Marcaine was mixed and then injected in a regional field block fashion in the subperiosteal plane via the gingivobuccal sulcus injection on either side as well as into the temporal fossa at the level of the true temporal fascia.  The upper eyelids were injected with 1 cc of 1% Xylocaine with 1:100,000 units of epinephrine.  Adequate time for vasoconstriction and anesthesia was allowed to be obtained.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 4-0 silk suture was placed in the right lower lid.  For traction, it was brought anteriorly.  The conjunctiva was incised with the needle tip Bovie with Jaeger lid plate protecting the cornea and globe.  A Q-Tip was then used to separate the orbicularis oculi muscle from the fat pad beneath and carried down to the bone.  The middle and medial fat pads were identified and a small amount of fat was removed from each to take care of the pseudofat herniation, which was present.  The inferior oblique muscle was identified, preserved, and protected throughout the procedure.  The transconjunctival incision was then closed with buried knots of 6-0 fast absorbing gut.  Contralateral side was treated in similar fashion with like results and throughout the procedure.  Lacri-Lube was in the eyes in order to maintain hydration.  Attention was next turned to the midface, where a temporal incision was made parallel to the nasojugal folds.  Dissection was carried out with the hemostat down to the true temporal fascia and the endoscopic temporal dissection dissector was used to elevate the true temporal fascia.  A 30-degree endoscope was used to visualize the fat pads, so that we knew we are in the proper plane.  Subperiosteal dissection was carried out over the zygomatic arch and Whitnall's tubercle and the temporal dissection was completed.,Next, bilateral gingivobuccal sulcus incisions were made and a Joseph elevator was used to elevate the periosteum of the midface and anterior face of the maxilla from the tendon of the masseter muscle up to Whitnall's tubercle.  The two dissection planes within joint in the subperiosteal fashion and dissection proceeded laterally out to the zygomatic neurovascular bundle.  It was bipolar electrocauteried and the tunnel was further dissected free and opened.  The endotine 4.5 soft tissue suspension device was then inserted through the temporal incision, brought down into the subperiosteal midface plane of dissection.  The guard was removed and the suspension spikes were engaged into the soft tissues.  The spikes were elevated superiorly such that a symmetrical midface elevation was carried out bilaterally.  The endotine device was then secured to the true temporal fascia with three sutures of 3-0 PDS suture.  Contralateral side was treated in similar fashion with like results in order to achieve facial symmetry and symmetry was obtained.  The gingivobuccal sulcus incisions were closed with interrupted 4-0 chromic and the scalp incision was closed with staples.  The sterile dressing was applied.  The patient was awakened in the operating room and taken to the recovery room in good condition.",

Aerobic culture was sent from the right buccal space abscess/cellulitis.,2.  Anaerobic culture from the same space was also obtained.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL,The patient was identified in the appropriate holding area and transported to #13.  The patient was intubated by anesthesia orotracheally using a #7 ET tube.  The patient was induced in effective sleep using a propofol and gas inhalation anesthetics.  Following intubation, the patient's mouth was cleaned with chlorhexidine and a toothbrush following placement of a throat pack.  At that point, approximately 5 mL of 2% lidocaine with 1:20,000 epinephrine was injected for a right inferior alveolar block, as well as local infiltration in the right long buccal nerve area as well as the right cheek area.  Local infiltration also was done near the tooth #32.  At this point, a periosteal elevator was used to loosen up the gingival tissue of the teeth #1, #29, and #32; and all 3 teeth were extracted using simple extraction, using elevators and forceps.  In addition, the previous Penrose drain was removed by removing the suture, and the incision that was used for I&D on the previous day was extended laterally.  A hemostat was used to puncture through to the right buccal space.  Approximately, 2.5 to 3 mL of purulence was drained, and that was used for Gram stain and culture, as mentioned above.  Following copious irrigation of the area, following the extraction and following the incision and drainage, 2 quarter-inch Penrose drains were placed in the anterior as well as the posterior section of the incision into the buccal space.  At this point copious irrigation was done again, the throat pack was removed, and the procedure was ended.  Note that the patient was extubated without incident.  Dr. B was present for all critical aspects of patient care.",

Maxillary atrophy.,2.  Severe mandibular atrophy.,3.  Acquired facial deformity.,4.  Masticatory dysfunction.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Autologous iliac crest bone graft to maxilla and mandible under general anesthetic.,Dr. X and company accompanied the patient to OR #6 at 7:30 a.m.  Nasal trachea intubation was performed per routine.  The bilateral iliac crest harvest was first performed by Dr. X and company under separate OR report.  Once the bone was harvested, surgical templets were used to recontour initially the maxillary graft and the mandibular graft.  Then, CAT scan models were used to find tune and adjust the bony contact regions for the maxillary tricortical block graft and the mandibular tricortical block graft.  Subsequent to the harvest of the bilateral ilium, the intraoral region was scrubbed per routine.  Surgical team scrubbed and gowned in usual fashion and the patient was draped.  Xylocaine 1%, 1:100,000 epinephrine 7 ml was infiltrated into the labial and palatal mucosa.  A primary incision was made in the maxilla starting on the patient's left tuberosity region along the crest of the residual ridge to the contralateral side in similar fashion.  Release incisions were made in the posterior region of the maxilla.,A full-thickness periosteal reflexion first exposed the palatal region.  The contents of the neurovascular canal from the greater palatine foramina were identified.  The hard palate was directly observed.  The facial tissues were then reflected exposing the lateral aspect of the maxilla, the zygomatic arch, the infraorbital nerve, artery and vein, the lateral piriform rim, the inferior piriform rim, and the remaining issue of the nasal spine.  Similar features were reflected on the contralateral side.  The area was re-contoured with rongeurs.  The block of bone, which was formed and harvested from the left ilium was then placed and found to be stable.  A surgical mallet then compressed this bone further into the region.  A series of five 2 mm diameter titanium screws measuring 14 mm to 16 mm long were then used to fixate the block of bone into the residual maxilla.  Particulate bone was then placed around the remaining block of bone.  A piece of AlloDerm mixed with Croften and patient's platelet-rich plasma, which was centrifuged from drawing 20 cc of blood was then mixed together and placed over the lateral aspect of the block.  The tissues were expanded then with a tissue Metzenbaum scissors and once the labial tissue was expanded, the tissues were approximated for primary closure without tension using interrupted and continuous sutures #3-0 Gore-Tex.  Attention was brought then to the mandible.  1% Xylocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated in the labial mucosa 5 cc were given.  A primary incision was made between the mental foramina and the residual crest of the ridge and reflected first to the lingual area observing the superior genial tubercle in the facial area degloving the mentalis muscle and exposing the anterior body.  The anterior body was found to be approximately 3 mm in height.  A posterior tunnel was done first on the left side along the mylohyoid ridge and then under retromolar pad to the external oblique and the ridge was then degloved.  A tunnel was formed in the posterior region separating the mental nerve artery and vein from the flap and exposing that aspect of the body of the mandible.  A similar procedure was done on the contralateral side.  The tissues were stretched with tissue scissors and then a high speed instrumentation was used to decorticate the anterior mandible using a 1.6 mm twist drill and a pear shaped bur was used in the posterior region to begin original exploratory phenomenon of repair.  A block of bone was inserted between the mental foramina and fixative with three 16 cm screws first with a twist drill then followed with self-tapping 2 mm diameter titanium screws.  The block of bone was further re-contoured in situ.  Particulate bone was then injected into the posterior tunnels bilaterally.  A piece of AlloDerm was placed over those particulate segments.  The tissues were approximated for primary closure using #3-0 Gore-Tex suture both interrupted and horizontal mattress in form.  The tissues were compressed for about four minutes to allow platelet clots to form and to help adhere the flap.,The estimated blood loss in the harvest of the hip was 100 cc.  The estimated blood loss in the intraoral procedure was 220 cc.  Total blood loss for the procedure 320 cc.  The fluid administered 300 cc.  The urine out 180.  All sponges were counted encountered for as were sutures.  The patient was taken to Recovery at approximately 12 o'clock noon.",

Oral surgery was consulted to evaluate the patient.,After evaluation of the facial CT with tracheal deviation and abscess in the left muscular space, it was determined that the patient needed to be taken urgently to the operating room under general anesthesia and have the abscess incision and drainage and removal of tooth #17.  Risks, benefits, alternatives, treatments were thoroughly discussed with the patient and consent was obtained.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  The patient was transported to operating room #4 at Clinic.  He was laid supine on the operating room table.  ASA monitors were attached and general anesthesia was induced with IV anesthetics and maintained with oral endotracheal intubation and inhalation of anesthetics.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual oral and maxillofacial surgery fashion.,The surgeon approached the operating room table in sterile fashion.  Approximately 2 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine were injected into the left submandibular area in the area of the incision.  After waiting appropriate time for local anesthesia to take effect, an 18-gauge needle was introduced into the left masticator space and approximately 5 mL of pus was removed.  This was sent for aerobic and anaerobic micro.  Using a 15-blade, a 2-cm incision was made in the left submandibular region, then a hemostat was introduced in blunt dissection into the medial border of the mandible was performed.  The left masticator space was thoroughly explored as well as the left submandibular space and submental space.  Pus was drained from this site.  Copious amounts of sterile fluid were irrigated into the site.,Attention was then directed intraorally where a moistened Ray-Tec sponge was placed in the posterior oropharynx to act as a throat pack.  Approximately 4 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine were injected into the left inferior alveolar nerve block.  Using a 15-blade, a full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap was developed around tooth #17.  The tooth was elevated and delivered, and the lingual area of tooth #17 was explored and more pus was expressed.  This pus was evacuated intraorally __________ suction.  The extraction site and the left masticator space were irrigated, and it was noted that the irrigation was communicating with extraoral incision in the neck.,A 0.25-inch Penrose drain was placed in the lingual aspect of the mandible extraorally through the neck and secured with 2-0 silk suture.  A tack stitch intraorally with 3-0 chromic suture was placed.  The throat pack was then removed.  An orogastric tube was placed and removed all other stomach contents and then removed.  At this point, the procedure was then determined to be over.  The patient was extubated, breathing spontaneously, and transported to PACU in good condition.",

He sustained a blunt trauma to his ribs resulting in multiple fractures and presumably also struck his mandible resulting in the above-mentioned fracture.  He was admitted to hospital in Harleton, Texas, where his initial evaluation showed the rib fractures have also showed a nodule on his right upper lobe as well as a mediastinal mass.  His mandible fracture was not noted initially.  The patient also has a history of prostate cancer and a renal cell carcinoma.  The patient at that point underwent a bronchoscopy with a biopsy of the mediastinal mass and the results of that biopsy are still pending.  The patient later saw a local oral surgeon.  He diagnosed his mandible fracture and advised him to seek treatment in Houston.  He presented to my office for evaluation on January 18, 2010, and he was found to have an extremely atrophic mandible with a fracture in the left parasymphysis region involving a failed dental implant, which had been placed approximately 15 years ago.  The patient had significant discomfort and could eat foods and drink fluids with difficulty.  Due to the nature of his fracture and the complex medical history, he was sent to the hospital for admission and following cardiac clearance, he was scheduled for surgery today.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room, and placed in a supine position.  Following a nasal intubation and induction of general anesthesia, the surgeon then scrubbed, gowned, and gloved in the normal sterile fashion.  The patient was then prepped and draped in a manner consistent with sterile procedures.  A marking pen was first used to outline the incision in the submental region and it was extended from the left mandibular body to the right mandibular body region, approximately 1.5 cm medial to the inferior border of the mandible.  A 1 mL of lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine was then infiltrated along the incision and then a 15-blade was used to incise through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  A combination of sharp and blunt dissection was then used to carry the dissection superiorly to the inferior border of the mandible.  Electrocautery as well as 4.0 silk ties were used for hemostasis.  A 15-blade was then used to incise the periosteum along the inferior border of the mandible and it was reflected exposing the mandible as well as the fracture site.  The fracture site was slightly distracted allowing access to the dental implant within the bone and it was easily removed from the wound.  Cultures of this site were also obtained and then the granulation tissue from the wound was also curetted free of the wound and sent for a histologic diagnosis.  Manipulation of the mandible was then used to achieve an anatomic reduction and then an 11-hole Synthes reconstruction plate was then used to stand on the fracture site.  Since there was an area of weakness in the right parasymphysis region, in the location of another dental implant, the bone plate was extended posterior to that site.  When the plate was adapted to the mandible, it was then secured to the bone with 9 screws, each being 2 mm in diameter and each screw was placed bicortically.  All the screws were also locking screws.  Following placement of the screws, there was felt to be excellent stability of the fracture, so the wound was irrigated with a copious amount of normal saline.  The incision was closed in multiple layers with 4.0 Vicryl in the muscular and subcutaneous layers and 5.0 nylon in the skin.  A sterile dressing was then placed over the incision.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room with spontaneous respirations and stable vital signs.  Estimated blood loss is 125 mL.",

      "text": "SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 38-year-old female who comes for dietary consultation for gestational diabetes.  Patient reports that she is scared to eat because of its impact on her blood sugars.  She is actually trying not to eat while she is working third shift at Wal-Mart.  Historically however, she likes to eat out with a high frequency.  She enjoys eating rice as part of her meals.  She is complaining of feeling fatigued and tired all the time because she works from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. at Wal-Mart and has young children at home.  She sleeps two to four hours at a time throughout the day.  She has been testing for ketones first thing in the morning when she gets home from work.,OBJECTIVE:,  Today's weight:  155.5 pounds.  Weight from 10/07/04 was 156.7 pounds.  A diet history was obtained.  Blood sugar records for the last three days reveal the following:  fasting blood sugars 83, 84, 87, 77; two-hour postprandial breakfast 116, 107, 97; pre-lunch 85, 108, 77; two-hour postprandial lunch 86, 131, 100; pre-supper 78, 91, 100; two-hour postprandial supper 125, 121, 161; bedtime 104, 90 and 88.  I instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for gestational diabetes.  The Lily Guide for Meal Planning was provided and reviewed.  Additional information on gestational diabetes was applied.  A sample 2000-calorie meal plan was provided with a carbohydrate budget established.,ASSESSMENT:,  Patient's basal energy expenditure adjusted for obesity is estimated at 1336 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirements, including a physical activity factor as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals to 2036 calories per day.  Her diet history reveals that she has somewhat irregular eating patterns.  In the last 24 hours when she was working at Wal-Mart, she ate at 5 a.m. but did not eat anything prior to that since starting work at 10 p.m.  We discussed the need for small frequent eating.  We identified carbohydrate as the food source that contributes to the blood glucose response.  We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are all good for her.  The only carbohydrates she was asked to entirely avoid would be the concentrated forms of refined sugars.  In regard to use of her traditional foods of rice, I pulled out a one-third cup measuring cup to identify a 15-gram equivalent of rice.  We discussed the need for moderating the portion of carbohydrates consumed at one given time.  Emphasis was placed at eating with a high frequency with a goal of eating every two to four hours over the course of the day when she is awake.  Her weight loss was discouraged.  Patient was encouraged to eat more generously but with attention to the amount of carbohydrates consumed at a time.,PLAN:,  The meal plan provided has a carbohydrate content that represents 40 percent of a 2000-calorie meal plan.  The meal plan was devised to distribute her carbohydrates more evenly throughout the day.  The meal plan was meant to reflect an example for her eating, while the patient was encouraged to eat according to appetite and not to go without eating for long periods of time.  The meal plan is as follows:  breakfast 2 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, lunch 2-3 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, dinner 2-3 carbohydrate servings, bedtime snack 1-2 carbohydrate servings.  Recommend patient include a solid protein with each of her meals as well as with her snack that occurs before going to sleep.  Encouraged adequate rest.  Also recommend adequate calories to sustain weight gain of one-half to one pound per week.  If the meal plan reflected does not support slow gradual weight gain, then we will need to add more foods accordingly.  This was a one-hour consultation.

She walks her daughter to school and back home each day which takes 20 minutes each way.  She is not a big milk drinker, but she does try to drink some.,OBJECTIVE:,  Weight is 238.3 pounds.  Weight from last week\u2019s visit was 238.9 pounds.  Prepregnancy weight is reported at 235 pounds.  Height is 62-3/4 inches.  Prepregnancy BMI is approximately 42-1/2.  Insulin schedule is NovoLog 70/30, 20 units in the morning and 13 units at supper time.  Blood sugar records for the last week reveal the following:  Fasting blood sugars ranging from 92 to 104 with an average of 97, two-hour postprandial breakfast readings ranging from 172 to 196 with an average of 181, two-hour postprandial lunch readings ranging from 149 to 189 with an average of 168 and two-hour postprandial dinner readings ranging from 109 to 121 with an average of 116.  Overall average is 140.  A diet history was obtained.  Expected date of confinement is May 1, 2005.  Instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for gestational diabetes.  A 2300 meal plan was provided and reviewed.  The Lily Guide for Meal Planning was provided and reviewed.,ASSESSMENT:,  Patient\u2019s basal energy expenditure adjusted for obesity is estimated at 1566 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirements, including physical activity factors as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals 2367 calories a day.  Her diet history reveals that she is eating three meals a day and three snacks.  The snacks were just added last week following presence of ketones in her urine.  We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are the foods that raise blood sugar the most.  We identified 15 gram equivalents of carbohydrate and established a carbohydrate budget.  We also discussed the goal of balancing food intake with blood sugar control and adequate caloric intake to sustain appropriate weight gain for the pregnancy of 1/2 a pound a week through the duration of the pregnancy.  We discussed the physiology of ketone production from inadequate calories or inadequate insulin and elevated blood sugars.  While a sample meal plan was provided reflecting the patient\u2019s carbohydrate budget I emphasized the need for her to eat according to her appetite, but to work at consistency in the volume of carbohydrates consumed at a given meal or a given snack from day to day.  Patient was assured that we can titrate the insulin to match whatever eating pattern is suitable for her as long as she can do it on a consistent basis.  At the same time she was encouraged to continue to eliminate the more concentrated forms of refined carbohydrates.,PLAN:,  Recommend the patient work with the following meal plan with a carbohydrate budget representing approximately 45% of the calories from carbohydrate.  Breakfast:  Three carbohydrate servings.  Morning snack:  One carbohydrate serving.  Lunch:  Four carbohydrate servings.  Afternoon snack:  One carbohydrate serving.  Supper:  Four carbohydrate servings.  Bedtime snack:  One carbohydrate serving.  Encouraged patient to include some solid protein with each of her meals as well as with the bedtime snack.  Encouraged three servings of dairy products per day to meet nutritional needs for calcium during pregnancy.  Recommend patient include a fruit or a vegetable with most of her meals.  Also recommend including solid protein with each meal as well as with the bedtime snack.  Charlie Athene reviewed blood sugars at this consultation as well, and made the following insulin adjustment:  Morning 70/30, will increase from 20 units up to 24 units and evening 70/30, we will increase from 13 units up to 16 units.

The mass increased in size and she was seen by her primary care physician and referred to orthopedic surgeon.  MRI showed inflammation and was thought to be secondary to rheumatoid arthritis.  The mass increased in size.  She eventually underwent a partial resection found to have pathologic grade 2 leiomyosarcoma, margins were impossible to assess, but were likely positive.  She was evaluated by Dr. X and Dr. Y and a decision was made to proceed with preoperative chemotherapy.  She began treatment with CIVI-CAD in December 2007.  Her course was complicated by pulmonary embolus, pneumonia, and subdural hematoma while on anticoagulation.  She eventually underwent surgical resection on May 1, 2008 with small area of residual disease, but otherwise clear margins.,HOSPITAL COURSE:,1.

      "text": "Because children need hearing to learn speech, hearing loss from fluid in the middle ear can result in speech delay.  Children begin to speak some words by 18 months.  Children with fluid in both ears can show significant delay in their use of language.  In addition, young children learn to pronounce words by hearing them spoken.  When there is a hearing loss, even a mild one, the spoken words of parents and siblings are distorted to the child with fluid in the ears.  Identification of fluid in the middle ear is important, not only to prevent future speech problems, but to avoid permanent damage to the eardrum and the middle ear.  Most children will have at least one ear infection before the age of four.,With treatment, the ear infections clear up promptly.  Without the follow-up visit, fluid may still be present, even though the child has no complaints or symptoms.  Therefore, it is essential that ear infections be rechecked after initial treatment.  Usually, the presence of fluid results in a \"mild conductive hearing loss.\" This could be as much as 30% hearing loss overall.  After the specialist confirms that fluid is present behind both eardrums, further medical treatment is often advised.  This may consist of additional antibiotics, decongestants, and in some cases, nasal sprays.  If fluid has been present for over 12 weeks, surgical drainage of the fluid is often indicated.  The decision to perform surgery should be based on the response to medical treatment, the degree of hearing loss and the appearance of the eardum itself under the surgical microscope.  Surgery which drains fluid involves a small incision in the eardrum, so that the fluid can be gently removed and a tube can be inserted.  The procedure, medically termed a myringotomy and tubes, or tympanostomy and tube, (BMT if Bilateral) or PET (Pressure Equalizing Tubes), is performed on children under general anesthesia.",

She confirms the history of loud snoring at night with witnessed apnea.  The result of the sleep study was reviewed.  This showed moderate sleep apnea with significant desaturation.  The patient was unable to tolerate treatment with CPAP.  At the office, we observed large tonsils and elongation and thickening of the uvula as well as redundant soft tissue of the palate.  A tortuous appearance of the septum also was observed.  This morning, I talked to the patient and his wife about the findings.  I reviewed the CT images.  He has no history of sinus infections and does not recall a history of nasal trauma.  We discussed the removal of tonsils and uvula and soft palate tissue and the hope that this would help with his airway.  Depending on the findings of surgery, I explained that I might remove that bone spur that we are seeing within the nasal passage.  I will get the best look at it when he is asleep.  We discussed recovery as well.  He visited with Dr. XYZ about the anesthetic produce.,PROCEDURE:,:  General tracheal anesthetic was administered by Dr. XYZ and Mr. Radke.  Afrin drops were placed in both nostrils and a cottonoid soaked with Afrin was placed in each side of the nose.  A Crowe-Davis mouth gag was placed.  The tonsils were very large and touched the uvula.  The uvula was relatively long and very thick and there were redundant folds of soft palate mucosa and prominent posterior and anterior tonsillar pillars.  Also, there was a cryptic appearance of the tonsils but there was no acute redness or exudate.  Retraction of the soft palate permitted evaluation of the nasopharynx with the mirror and the choanae were patent and there was no adenoid tissue present.  A very crowded pharynx was appreciated.  The tonsils were first removed using electrodissection technique.  Hemostasis was achieved with the electrocautery and with sutures of 0 plain catgut.  The tonsil fossae were injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  There already was more room in the pharynx, but the posterior pharyngeal wall was still obscured by the soft palate and uvula.  The uvula was grasped with the Alice clamp.  I palpated the posterior edge of the hard palate and calculated removal of about a third of the length of the soft palate.  We switched over from the Bayonet cautery to the blunt needle tip electrocautery.  The planned anterior soft palate incision was marked out with the electrocautery from the left anterior tonsillar pillar rising upwards and then extending horizontally across the soft palate to include all of the uvula and a portion of the soft palate, and the incision then extended across the midline and then inferiorly to meet the right anterior tonsillar pillar.  This incision was then deepened with the electrocautery on a cutting current.  The uvular artery just to the right of the midline was controlled with the suction electrocautery.  The posterior soft palate incision was made parallel to the anterior soft palate incision but was made leaving a longer length of mucosa to permit closure of the palatoplasty.  A portion of the redundant soft palate mucosa tissue also was included with the resection specimen and the tissue including the soft palate and uvula was included with the surgical specimen as the tonsils were sent to pathology.  The tonsil fossae were injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  The soft palate was also injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  The posterior tonsillar pillars were then brought forward to close to the anterior tonsillar pillars and these were sutured down to the tonsil bed with interrupted 0 plain catgut sutures.  The posterior soft palate mucosa was advanced forward and brought up to the anterior soft palate incision and closure of the soft palate wound was then accomplished with interrupted 3-0 chromic catgut sutures.  A much improved appearance of the oropharynx with a greatly improved airway was appreciated.  A moist tonsil sponge was placed into the nasopharynx and the mouth gag was removed.  I removed the cottonoids from both nostrils.  Speculum exam showed the inferior turbinates were large, the septum was tortuous and it angulated to the right and then sharply bent back to the left.  The septum was injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine using a separate syringe and needle.  A #15 blade was used to make a left cheilion incision.,Mucoperichondrium and mucoperiosteum were elevated with the Cottle elevator.  When we reached the deflected portion of the vomer, this was separated from the septal cartilage with a Freer elevator.  The right-sided mucoperiosteum was elevated with the Freer elevator and then with Takahashi forceps and with the 4 mm osteotome, the deflected portion of the septal bone from the vomer was resected.  This tissue also was sent as a separate specimen to pathology.  The intraseptal space was irrigated with saline and suctioned.  The nasal septal mucosal flaps were then sutured together with a quilting suture of 4-0 plain catgut.  I observed no evidence of purulent secretion or polyp formation within the nostrils.  The inferior turbinates were then both outfractured using a knife handle, and now there was a much more patent nasal airway on both sides.  There was good support for the nasal tip and the dorsum and there was good hemostasis within the nose.  No packing was used in the nostrils.  Polysporin ointment was introduced into both nostrils.  The mouth gag was reintroduced and the pack removed from the nasopharynx.  The nose and throat were irrigated with saline and suctioned.  An orogastric tube was placed and a moderate amount of clear fluid suctioned from the stomach and this tube was removed.  Sponge and needle count were reported correct.  The mouth gag having been withdrawn, the patient was then awakened and returned to recovery room in a satisfactory condition.  He tolerated the operation excellently.  Estimated blood loss was about 15-20 cc.  In the recovery room, I observed that he was moving air well and I spoke with his wife about the findings of surgery.",

      "text": "CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Testicular pain.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is a 4-year-old boy with a history of abrupt onset of left testicular pain at 11:30 this morning.  He was unable to walk and would not stand upright, and had fairly significant discomfort, so the parents checked his panel because of it.  Because of this, they took him to Emergency Department, at which time, he had no swelling noted initially, but very painful.  He had no voiding or stooling problems.  No nausea, vomiting or fever.  Family denies trauma or dysuria.  At that time, he was going to get an ultrasound done, but the mother said that all of sudden the patient stated the pain had resolved.  He has had hot chocolate this morning at 10:30 in the morning and water around 2:30 in the morning.  He has not had any pain since but states that he has had pain in the past, not as long and states there was a twisting sensation.  He has no recent cold or flu, although he had rhinorrhea about 3 weeks ago.  He is on no medications and he is here for evaluation.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  The patient has no known allergies.  He is term delivery via spontaneous vaginal delivery.  He has had no problems or hospitalizations with circumcision.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , He has had no previous surgeries.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  All 14-point review of systems were negative except for the above left testicular pain and the history of possible upper respiratory infection about 2 to 3 weeks ago.,IMMUNIZATIONS: , Up-to-date.,FAMILY HISTORY: , The patient lives at home with both parents who are Spanish speaking.  He is not in school.,MEDICATIONS:,  He is on no medications.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  On physical exam, weight is 15.9 kg.,GENERAL:  The patient is a cooperative little boy.,HEENT:  Normal head and neck exam.  No oral or nasal discharge.,NECK:  Without masses.,CHEST:  Without masses.,LUNGS:  Clear.,CARDIAC:  Without murmurs or gallops.,ABDOMEN:  Soft.  No masses or tenderness.  His scrotum did not have any swelling at the present time.  There was only minimal discomfort with palpation at the left inguinal area, but no masses were noted.  No palpable nodules such as appendix testis and no swelling was noted and he had mild epididymal swelling only.  His left testis was slightly harder than the right, but this was not very significant.,EXTREMITIES:  He had full range of motion in all 4 extremities.,SKIN:  Warm, pink, and dry.,NEUROLOGIC:  Grossly intact.,LABORATORY DATA: , Ultrasound was obtained today showing no blood flow or poor blood flow on the left except for increased blood flow to the epididymis on the study done at about 1330 hours, and second one done around 1630 hours was normal flow, possible increased flow on the left.  This is personally reviewed by me.  The right was normal.  No masses were appreciated.  There was some mild change in echotexture on the left on the initial study, which had apparently resolved on the second, but may be due to the technical aspects of the study.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN: , The patient has a possibly torsion detorsion versus other acute testicular problem.  If the patient has indeed testicular torsion, there is an increased possibility that it may reoccur again, actually within the first 24 to 36 hours and as such is recommended doing a left scrotal exploration with possible detorsion of left testis, possible orchiectomy if the testis is markedly abnormal or nonviable, which probably is not the case, and bilateral testes fixation if the torsion is found.  I discussed the pre and postsurgical care with the parents.  Procedure itself with potential complications, risks, benefits, and alternatives of surgery including that the torsion could occur again, although it is less likely after the surgical fixation procedure.  The parents understand and wished to proceed.  We will schedule this later today emergently.",

      "text": "HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  ,The patient is a 13-year-old, who has a history of Shone complex and has a complete heart block.  He is on the pacemaker.  He had a coarctation of the aorta and that was repaired when he was an infant.  He was followed in our Cardiology Clinic here and has been doing well.  However last night, he was sleeping, and he states he felt as if he has having a dream, and there was thunder in this dream, which woke him up.  He then felt that his defibrillator was going off and this has continued and feels like his heart rate is not normal.  Thus, his dad put him in the car and transported him here.  He has been evaluated here.  He had some scar tissue at one point when the internal pacemaker was not working properly and had to have that replaced.  It was 2 a.m. when he woke, and again, he was brought here by private vehicle.  He was well prior to going to bed.  No cough, cold, runny nose, fever.  No trauma has been noted.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Shone complex, pacemaker dependent.,MEDICATIONS: , He is on no medications at this time.,ALLERGIES:,  He has no allergies.,IMMUNIZATIONS:,  Up to date.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , He lives with his parents.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Negative.,REVIEW OF SYSTEM: , Twelve asked, all negative, except as noted above.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  This is an awake, alert male, who appears to be in mild distress.,HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  His TMs are clear.  His nares are clear.  The mucous membranes are pink and moist.  Throat is clear.,NECK:  Supple without lymphadenopathy or masses.  Trachea is midline.,LUNGS:  Clear.,HEART:  Shows bradycardia at 53.  He has good distal pulses.,ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender.  Positive bowel sounds.  No guarding, no rebound.  No rashes are seen.,HOSPITAL COURSE:,  Initial blood pressure is 164/90.  He was moved in room 1.  He was placed on nasal cannula.  Pulse ox was 100%, which is normal.  We placed him on a monitor.  We did an EKG; it has not appear to be capturing his pacemaker at this time.  Shortly after the patient's arrival, the Medtronic technician came and worked out his pacemaker.  Medtronic representative informed me that the lead that he has in place has been recalled because it has been prone to microfractures, oversensing, and automatic defibrillation.  As noted, he was transferred to room 1, placed on a monitor, pulse ox.  An IV was placed.  A standard blood work was sent.  A chest x-ray was done showing normal heart size, lead appeared to be in placed.  There was no evidence of pulmonary edema.  His pacemaker did not appear to be capturing.  We placed him on transthoracic leads.  However, it is difficult to get good placement with these because of the area where his pacemaker was placed.  The Medtronic technician initially turned off his defibrillation mode and turned down his sensor.  However, we could not get our transthoracic pacer to capture his heart.  When the Medtronic representative turned off the pacemaker, the heart rate seemed to drop into the 40s.  The patient appeared to be in pain.  We placed it back on a rate of 60 at that time.  He has remained in sinus bradycardia, but no evidence of ectopic beats.  No widening of his QRS complex.  I spoke with Cardiology.  Cardiology service has come in, has evaluated him at bedside with me.  Again, we turned up the transthoracic pacer, but it is again not seem to be picking up, and his heart rate is still going with the Medtronic's internal pacemaker.  So with the ICU physician on call, Dr. X, he has agreed with taking this young man to the ICU.,An hour after presentation here, the ICU was ready for bed.  I accompanied the patient up to the ICU.  He remained awake and alert.  Initially, he was complaining of a lot of chest pain.  Once the defibrillator was turned off, he had no more pain.  He was transported to the Pediatrics PICU and delivered in stable condition.,LABORATORY DATA: , CBC was normal.  Chem-20 was normal as well.,IMPRESSION:  ,Complete heart block with pacemaker malfunction.,PLAN:  ,He is admitted to the ICU.,TIME SEEN: , Critical care time outside billable procedures was 45 minutes with this patient.

The patient subsequently then had a CT scan which demonstrated a very large thyroid gland, especially on the left side with substernal extension down to the level of the aortic arch.  The patient was then immediately set up for surgery.  After risks, complications, consequences, and questions were addressed with the patient, a written consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operative suite by Anesthesia and placed on the operative table in the supine position.  The patient was then placed under general endotracheal intubation anesthesia and the patient then had a shoulder roll placed.  After this, the patient then had the area marked initially.  The preoperative setting was then localized with 1% lidocaine and epinephrine 1:100,000 approximately 10 cc total.  After this, the patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A #15 Bard-Parker was then utilized to make a skin incision horizontally, approximately 5 cm on either side from midline.  After this, a blunt dissection was then utilized to dissect the subcutaneous fat from the platysmal muscle.  There appeared to be a natural dehiscence of the platysma in the midline.  A sub-platysmal dissection was then performed in the superior, inferior, and lateral directions with the help of a bear claw, Metzenbaum scissors and DeBakey forceps.  Any bleeding was controlled with monopolar cauterization.  After this, the two anterior large jugular veins were noted and resected laterally.  The patient's trachea appeared to be slightly deviated to the right with identification finally of the midline raphe, off midline to the right.  This was grasped on either side with a DeBakey forceps and dissected with monopolar cauterization and dissected with a Metzenbaum scissors.  After this was dissected, the sternohyoid muscles were resected laterally and separated from the sternothyroid muscles.  The sternothyroid muscles were then bluntly freed and dissected from the right thyroid gland.  After this, attention was then drawn to the left gland, where the sternothyroid muscle was dissected bluntly on this side utilizing finger dissection and Kitners.  The left thyroid gland was freed initially superiorly and worked inferiorly and laterally until the gland was pulled from the substernal region by blunt dissection and reflected and pulled anteriorly.  After this, the superior and inferior parathyroid glands were noted.  The dissection was carried very close to the thyroid gland to try to select these parathyroids posteriorly.  After this, the superior pole was then identified and the superior laryngeal artery and vein were cross clamped and tied with __________ undyed Vicryl tie.  The superior pole was finally freed and a small little feeding branched vessels from this area were cauterized with the bipolar cautery and cut with Metzenbaum scissors.  After this, the thyroid gland was further freed down to the level of the Berry's ligament inferiorly and the dissection was carried once again more superiorly.  The fine stats were then utilized to dissect along the superior aspect of the recurrent laryngeal nerve on the left side with freeing of the connective Berry's ligament tissue from the gland with the bipolar cauterization and the fine stat.  Finally, attention was then drawn back to the patient's right side where the gland was rotated more anteriorly with fine dissection utilizing a fine stat to reflect the superior and inferior parathyroid glands laterally and posteriorly.  The recurrent laryngeal nerve on this side was identified and further dissection was carried superiorly and anteriorly through this nerve to finally free the right side of the gland to Berry's ligament.  The middle thyroid vein and inferior thyroid arteries were cross clamped and tied with #2-0 undyed Vicryl ties and also bipolared with the bipolar cauterization bilaterally.  The Berry's ligament was then finally freed and the gland was then passed to scrub tech and passed off the field to Pathology.  The neck was then thoroughly irrigated with normal saline solution and further bleeding was controlled with bipolar cauterization.  After this, Surgicel was then placed in the bilateral neck regions and a #10 Jackson-Pratt drain was then placed within the left neck region with some extension over to the right neck region.  This was brought out through the inferior skin incision and secured to the skin with a #2-0 nylon suture.  The strap muscles were then reapproximated with a running #3-0 Vicryl suture followed by reapproximation of the platysma and subcutaneous tissue with a #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  The skin was then reapproximated with a #5-0 Prolene subcuticular along with a #6-0 fast over the top.  After this, Mastisol Steri-Strips and Bacitracin along with a sterile dressing and a __________ dressing were then placed.  The patient intraoperatively did have approximately 50 cc of bloody drainage from this area within the JP drain.  The patient was then turned back to Anesthesia, extubated in the operating room and transferred to Recovery in stable condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and remained stable throughout.",

Risks, benefits, alternatives of the procedures were discussed in great detail with the patient.  Risks include but were not limited to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, injury to nerve, vocal fold paralysis, hoarseness, low calcium, need for calcium supplementation, tumor recurrence, need for additional treatment, need for thyroid medication, cosmetic deformity, and other.  The patient understood all these issues and they wished to proceed.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Multinodular thyroid goiter with compressive symptoms and bilateral dominant thyroid nodules proven to be benign by fine needle aspiration.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Multinodular thyroid goiter with compressive symptoms and bilateral dominant thyroid nodules proven to be benign by fine needle aspiration.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: , After identifying the patient, the patient was placed supine in a operating room table.  After establishing general anesthesia via oral endotracheal intubation with a 6 Nerve Integrity monitoring system endotracheal tube.  The eyes were then tacked with Tegaderm.  The Nerve Integrity monitoring system, endotracheal tube was confirmed to be working adequately.  Essentially a 7 cm incision was employed in the lower skin crease of the neck.  A 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine were given.  Shoulder roll was applied.  The patient prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A 15-blade was used to make the incision.  Subplatysmal flaps were raised to the thyroid notch and sternal respectively.  The strap muscles were separated in the midline.  As we then turned to the left side where the sternohyoid muscle was separated from the sternothyroid muscle there was a very dense and firm thyroid mass on the left side.  The sternothyroid muscle was transected horizontally.  Similar procedure was performed on the right side.,Attention was then turned to identify the trachea in the midline.  Veins in this area and the pretracheal region were ligated with a harmonic scalpel.  Subsequently, attention was turned to dissecting the capsule off of the left thyroid lobe.  Again this was very firm in nature.  The superior thyroid pole was dissected in the superior third artery, vein, and the individual vessels were ligated with a harmonic scalpel.  The inferior and superior parathyroid glands were protected.  Recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified in the tracheoesophageal groove.  This had arborized early as a course underneath the inferior thyroid artery to a very small tiny anterior motor branch.  This was followed superiorly.  The level of cricothyroid membrane upon complete visualization of the entire nerve, Berry's ligament was transected and the nerve protected and then the thyroid gland was dissected over the trachea.  A prominent pyramidal level was also appreciated and dissected as well.,Attention was then turned to the right side.  There was significant amount of thyroid tissue that was very firm.  Multiple nodules were appreciated.  In a similar fashion, the capsule was dissected.  The superior and inferior parathyroid glands protected and preserved.  The superior thyroid artery and vein were individually ligated with the harmonic scalpel and the inferior thyroid artery was then ligated close to the thyroid gland capsule.  Once the recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified again on this side, the nerve had arborized early prior to the coursing underneath the inferior thyroid artery.  The anterior motor branch was then very fine, almost filamentous and stimulated at 0.5 milliamps, completely dissected toward the cricothyroid membrane with complete visualization.  A small amount of tissue was left at the Berry's ligament as the remainder of thyroid level was dissected over the trachea.  The entire thyroid specimen was then removed, marked with a stitch upon the superior pole.  The wound was copiously irrigated, Valsalva maneuver was given, bleeding points controlled.

      "text": "TITLE OF OPERATION: , Central neck reoperation with removal of residual metastatic lymphadenopathy and thyroid tissue in the central neck.  Left reoperative neck dissection levels 1 and the infraclavicular fossa on the left side.  Right levels 2 through 5 neck dissection and superior mediastinal dissection of lymph nodes and pretracheal dissection of lymph nodes in a previously operative field.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient is a 37-year-old gentleman well known to me with a history of medullary thyroid cancer sporadic in nature having undergone surgery in 04/07 with final pathology revealing extrafocal, extrathyroidal extension, and extranodal extension in the soft tissues of his medullary thyroid cancer.  The patient had been followed for a period of time and underwent rapid development of a left and right infraclavicular lymphadenopathy and central neck lymphadenopathy also with imaging studies to suggest superior mediastinal disease.  Fine-needle aspiration of the left and right infraclavicular lymph nodes revealed persistent medullary thyroid cancer.  Risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedures discussed with in detail and the patient elected to proceed with surgery as discussed.  The risks included, but not limited to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, injury to nerve, lip, tongue, shoulder, weakness, tongue numbness, droopy eyelid, tumor comes back, need for additional treatment, diaphragm weakness, pneumothorax, need for chest tube, others.  The patient understood all these issues and did wish to proceed.,PROCEDURE DETAIL:  ,After identifying the patient, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table.  The patient was intubated with a number 7 nerve integrity monitor system endotracheal tube.  The eyes were protected with Tegaderm.  The patient was rotated to 180 degrees towards the operating surgeon.  The Foley catheter was placed into the bladder with good return of urine.  Attention then was turned to securing the nerve integrity monitor system endotracheal tube and this was confirmed to be working adequately.  A previous apron incision was incorporated and advanced over onto the right side to the mastoid tip.  The incision then was planned around the old scar to be excised.  A 1% lidocaine with 1 to 100,000 epinephrine was injected.  A shoulder roll was applied.  The incision was made, the apron flap was raised to the level of the mandible and mastoid tip bilaterally all the way down to the clavicle and sternal notch inferiorly.  Attention was then turned to performing the level 1 dissection on the left.  Subsequently the marginal mandibular nerve was identified over the facial notch of the mandible.  The facial artery and vein were individually ligated and marginal mandibular nerve traced superiorly and perifascial lymph nodes freed from the marginal mandibular nerve.  Level 1A lymph nodes of the submental region were dissected off the mylohyoid and digastric.  The submandibular gland was appreciated and retracted laterally.  The mylohyoid muscle appreciated.  The lingual nerve was appreciated and the submandibular ganglion was ligated.  The hypoglossal nerve was appreciated and protected and digastric tunnel was then made posteriorly and the lymph nodes posterior along the marginal mandibular nerve and into the parotid gland were then dissected and incorporated into the specimen for histopathologic analysis.  The marginal mandibular nerve stimulated at the completion of this portion of the procedure.  Attention was then turned to incising the fascia along the clavicle on the left side.  Dissection then ensued along the floor of the neck palpating a very large bulky lymph node before the neck was identified.  The brachial plexus and phrenic nerve were identified.  The internal jugular vein identified and the mass was freed from the floor of the neck with careful dissection and suture ligation of vessels.  Attention was then turned to the central neck.  The strap muscles were appreciated in the midline.  There was a large firm mass measuring approximately 3 cm that appeared to be superior to the strap musculature.  A careful dissection with incorporation of a portion of the sternal hyoid muscle in this area for a margin was then performed.  Attention was then turned to identify the carotid artery and the internal jugular vein on the left side.  This was traced inferiorly, internal jugular vein to the brachiocephalic vein.  Palpation deep to this area into the mediastinum and up against the trachea revealed a 1.5 cm lymph node mass.  Subsequently this was carefully dissected preserving the brachiocephalic vein and also the integrity of the trachea and the carotid artery and these lymph nodes were removed in full and sent for histopathologic analysis.  Attention was then turned to the right neck dissection.  A posterior flap on the right was raised to the anterior border of the trapezius.  The accessory nerve was identified in the posterior triangle and traced superiorly and inferiorly.  Attention was then turned to identifying the submandibular gland.  A digastric tunnel was performed back to the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The fascia overlying the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right side was incised and the omohyoid muscle was appreciated.  The omohyoid muscle was retracted inferiorly.  Penrose drain was placed around the inferior aspect of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  Subsequently the internal jugular vein was identified.  The external jugular vein ligated about 1 cm above the clavicle.  Palpation in this area and the infraclavicular region on the right revealed a firm irregular lymph node complex.  Dissection along the floor of the neck then was performed to allow for mobilization.  The transverse cervical artery and vein were individually ligated to allow full mobilization of this mass.  Tissue between the phrenic nerve and the internal jugular vein was clamped and suture ligated.  The tissue was then brought posteriorly from the trapezius muscle to the internal jugular vein and traced superiorly.  The cervical rootlets were transected after the contribution, so the phrenic nerve all the way superiorly to the skull base.  The hypoglossal nerve was identified and protected as the lymph node packet was dissected over the internal jugular vein.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  Valsalva maneuver was given.  No bleeding points identified.  The wound was then prepared for closure.  Two number 10 JPs were placed through the left supraclavicular fossa in the previous drain sites and secured with 3-0 nylon.  The wound was closed  with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl for platysma, subsequently a 4-0 running Biosyn for the skin, and Indermil.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated on the operating room table, and sent to the postanesthesia care unit in good condition.",

He presented now after informed consent for the above procedure.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was identified in the preanesthesia area, then taken to the operating room, placed in the supine position on the operating table, and induced under general endotracheal anesthesia.  The patient was correctly positioned, padded at all pressure points, had antiembolic TED hose and Flowtrons in the lower extremities.  The anterior abdomen was then prepared and draped in a sterile fashion.  Preemptive local anesthetic was infiltrated with 1% lidocaine and 0.5% ropivacaine.  The initial incision was made sharply at the umbilicus with a #15-scalpel blade and carried down through deeper tissues with Bovie cautery, down to the midline fascia with a #15 scalpel blade.  The blunt-tipped Hasson introducer cannula was placed into the abdominal cavity under direct vision where it was insufflated using carbon dioxide gas to a pressure of 15 mmHg.  The epigastric and right subcostal trocars were placed under direct vision.  The right upper quadrant was well visualized.  The gallbladder was noted to be significantly distended with surrounding dense adhesions.  The fundus of the gallbladder was grasped and retracted anteriorly and superiorly, and the surrounding adhesions were then taken down off the gallbladder using a combination of the bullet-nose Bovie dissector and the blunt Kittner peanut dissector.  Further dissection allowed identification of the infundibulum and cystic duct junction where the cystic duct was identified and dissected out further using a right-angle clamp.  The cystic duct was clipped x3 and then divided.  The cystic artery was dissected out in like fashion, clipped x3, and then divided.  The gallbladder was then taken off the liver bed in a retrograde fashion using the hook-tip Bovie cautery with good hemostasis.  Prior to removal of the gallbladder, all irrigation fluid was clear.  No active bleeding or oozing was seen.  All clips were noted to be secured and intact and in place.  The gallbladder was placed in a specimen pouch after placing the camera in the epigastric port.  The gallbladder was retrieved through the umbilical fascial defect and submitted to Pathology.  The camera was placed back once again into the abdominal cavity through the umbilical port, and all areas remained clean and dry and the trocar was removed under direct visualization.  The insufflation was allowed to escape.  The umbilical fascia was closed using interrupted #1 Vicryl sutures.  Finally, the skin was closed in a layered subcuticular fashion with interrupted 3-0 and 4-0 Monocryl.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.,",

Upon seeing the patient and discussing in extent with the family, it was decided the patient needed to go to the operating room for this nonreducible umbilical hernia and bowel obstruction and the family agreed with surgery.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient was found to have an incarcerated umbilical hernia.  There was a loop of small bowel incarcerated within the hernia sac.  It showed signs of ecchymosis, however no signs of any ischemia or necrosis.  It was easily reduced once opening the abdomen and the rest of the small bowel was ran without any other defects or abnormalities.,PROCEDURE: , After informed written consent, risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and the patient's family.  The patient was brought to the operating suite.  After general endotracheal intubation, prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  A midline incision was made around the umbilical hernia defect with a #10 blade scalpel.  Dissection was then carried down to the fascia.  Using a sharp dissection, an incision was made above the defect superior to the defect entering the fascia.  The abdomen was entered under direct visualization.  The small bowel that was entrapped within the hernia sac was easily reduced and observed and appeared to be ecchymotic, however, no signs of ischemia were noted or necrosis.  The remaining of the fascia was then extended using Metzenbaum scissors.  The hernia sac was removed using Mayo scissors and sent off as specimen.  Next, the bowel was run from the ligament of Treitz to the ileocecal valve with no evidence of any other abnormalities.  The small bowel was then milked down removing all the fluid.  The bowel was decompressed distal to the obstruction.  Once returning the abdominal contents to the abdomen, attention was next made in closing the abdomen and using #1 Vicryl suture in the figure-of-eight fashion the fascia was closed.  The umbilicus was then reapproximated to its anatomical position with a #1 Vicryl suture.  A #3-0 Vicryl suture was then used to reapproximate the deep dermal layers and skin staples were used on the skin.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery in stable condition.",

      "text": "HISTORY:,  This is an initial visit for this 95-year-old gentleman with a Hospice diagnosis of CHF.  He was referred to us by Dr. ABC, who reveals a long history of cardiomyopathy and a recent decrease in his ejection fraction to approximately 20-25%.  The patient was seen in the office approximately three days ago with a clinical diagnosis of bronchitis.  The FES, as well as the daughter report that he has had significant clinical and functional decline over the last two to three weeks.  He is no longer ambulatory.  His appetite is significantly decreased and he had significant unmeasured weight loss.  He is notably more weak.  He is unable to perform any of the activities of daily living and he is increasingly somnolent with poor sleep at night.  The patient says that he is ready to die, that he is after all 95 years old and is aware that his clinical and functional status has been declining.  He worked as a chef for almost seven decades and retired approximately two years ago.  He denies pain.  He admits to some cough, but he believes the cough is improved on the current antibiotic.  He does note that he sleeps poorly and unable to indicate a cause for that difficulty in sleeping.  He reports that he recently made a trip to California where he said goodbye to his children that live there.  The patient reports that his goals of care are to stay at home.  He has never been hospitalized with the exception of some surgery on his back in Houston, Texas decades ago that he has no interest in going to a hospital and that he would be happy to sign a DNR form and that he would like no heroics performed in the event that his heart or breathing stops.  He denies anxiety or depression and feels that his life has been quite full and quite successful and that when time comes, he is ready to go.,MEDICATIONS:,  His medications include Avelox 400 mg.  He is on day four of a seven-day dose.  He is on Coreg 3.125 mg a day, lisinopril 5 mg a day, Coumadin 2.5 mg a day, digoxin 0.125 mg every other day, Lasix 80 mg twice daily, Inspra twice daily, and he is on a transdermal nitro patch 12 hours on and 12 hours off.  He takes Tylenol extra strength every four to six hours for bilateral shoulder pain typically one to two doses a day.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Exam reveals a cachectic somnolent gentleman, who appears to be comfortable.  His blood pressure is 90/60.  His heart rate is 80 and irregular.  His respiratory rate is 14.  Head reveals marked temporal wasting.  He is anicteric.  The pupils are equal and round.  There is jugular venous distention noted approximately 2-3 cm above the notch.  Chest shows good air entry bilaterally with scattered rhonchi.  No audible wheezing.  His heart sounds are irregular and there is a musical systolic ejection murmur radiating to the axilla.  The abdomen is soft with a large midline well-healed surgical scar.  The bowel sounds are normoactive.  There is no tenderness or palpable organomegaly.  He has 2+ edema of his lower extremities with some weeping of the right lower extremity and no evidence of infection.  Neurologically, while somnolent easily aroused and speech is quite clear.  He identities the date as October of 2008, but is otherwise oriented.  His short-term memory is quite poor.  His insight is also poor.  He appears to be somewhat sad.  There are mild regular tremors, right hand worse than left, but there is otherwise no focal neurological deficit.,A phone conversation with his daughter, Xyz, his health care proxy, ensued.  His daughter is very concerned with his clinical decline and is raising the question of whether he would benefit from hospitalization.  She reports that her mother died after a many-year course with heart failure and had upwards of three dozen hospitalizations.  At each hospitalization, she seem to derive benefit and wondered if her dad would drive equal benefit from hospitalizations.  She is aware that he is unwilling to be hospitalized and I believe hopefully that the Hospice team might persuade him.  She also reports that he has been talking about dying for nearly five years.,ASSESSMENT:,  A 95-year-old gentleman with endstage CHF with recent significant clinical and functional decline.  The patient appears to have relatively little in the way of symptoms, although perhaps some sleep hygiene might be of help.  While today the patient appears to be very calm and sedated, the history is one of significant emotional lability.  Family is having great difficulty accepting the terminality of the patient's circumstances.,PLAN:,  A DNR was placed in the house after the above-noted conversation was had.  I believe the patient might benefit from low-dose hypnotic and 7.5 mg of Restoril was ordered.  Reassessment of the patient's condition is warranted.  A family meeting will be offered to review the circumstances of the patient's condition in hopes that family might better accept his wishes and to develop a plan of care for this gentleman.",

      "text": "CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Right shoulder pain.,HISTORY: , The patient is a pleasant, 31-year-old, right-handed, white female who injured her shoulder while transferring a patient back on 01/01/02.  She formerly worked for Veteran's Home as a CNA.  She has had a long drawn out course of treatment for this shoulder.  She tried physical therapy without benefit and ultimately came to a subacromion decompression in November 2002.  She had ongoing pain and was evaluated by Dr. X who felt that she had a possible brachial plexopathy.  He also felt she had a right superficial radial neuritis and blocked this with resolution of her symptoms.  He then referred her to ABCD who did EMG testing, demonstrating a right suprascapular neuropathy although a C5 radiculopathy could not be ruled out.  MRI testing on the cervical spine was then done which was negative for disk herniation and she underwent suprascapular nerve decompression of the scapular notch on 12/18/03.  She finally went to an anterior axillary nerve block because of ongoing pain in the anterior shoulder again by Dr. X.  She comes to me for impairment rating.  She has no chronic health problems otherwise, fevers, chills, or general malaise.  She is not working.  She is right-hand dominant.  She denies any prior history of injury to her shoulder.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Negative aside from above.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Noncontributory.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,Please see above.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Negative aside from above.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,A pleasant, age appropriate woman, moderately overweight, in no apparent distress.  Normal gait and station, normal posture, normal strength, tone, sensation and deep tendon reflexes with the exception of 4+/5 strength in the supraspinatus musculature on the right.  She has decreased motion in the right shoulder as follows.  She has 160 degrees of flexion, 155 degrees of abduction, 35 degrees of extension, 25 degrees of adduction, 45 degrees of internal rotation and 90 degrees of external rotation.  She has a positive impingement sign on the right.,ASSESSMENT:,  Right shoulder impingement syndrome, right suprascapular neuropathy.,DISCUSSION: , With a reasonable degree of medical certainty, she is at maximum medical improvement and she does have an impairment based on AMA Guide to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition.  The reason for this impairment is the incident of 01/01/02.  For her suprascapular neuropathy, she is rated as a grade IV motor deficit which I rate as a 13% motor deficit.  This is multiplied by a maximum upper extremity impairment for involvement of the suprascapular nerve of 16% which produces a 2% impairment of the upper extremity when the two values are multiplied together, 2% impairment of the upper extremity.  For her lack of motion in the shoulder she also has additional impairment on the right.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder flexion.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder abduction.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder adduction.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder extension.  There is no impairment for findings in shoulder external rotation.  She has a 3% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder internal rotation.  Thus the impairment due to lack of motion in her shoulder is a 6% impairment of the upper extremity.  This combines with the 2% impairment of the upper extremity due to weakness in the suprascapular nerve root distribution to produce an 8% impairment of the upper extremity which in turn is a 5% impairment of the whole person based on the AMA Guide to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition, stated with a reasonable degree of medical certainty.",

His confidence and self-esteem are significantly low.  He stated he has excessive somnolence, his energy level is extremely low, motivation is low, and he has a lack for personal interests.  He has had suicidal ideation, but this is currently in remission.  Furthermore, he continues to have hopeless thoughts and crying spells.  Mr. T stated these symptoms appeared approximately two months ago.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , On March 25, 2003, Mr. T was fired from his job secondary, to an event at which he stated he was first being harassed by another employee.\" This other, employee had confronted Mr. T with a very aggressive, verbal style, where this employee had placed his face directly in front of Mr. T was spitting on him, and called him \"bitch.\" Mr. T then retaliated, and went to hit the other employee.  Due to this event, Mr. T was fired.  It should be noted that Mr. T stated he had been harassed by this individual for over a year and had reported the harassment to his boss and was told to \"deal with it.\",There are no other apparent stressors in Mr. T's life at this time or in recent months.  Mr. T stated that work was his entire life and he based his entire identity on his work ethic.  It should be noted that Mr. T was a process engineer for Plum Industries for the past 14 years.,PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:,  There is no evidence of any psychiatric hospitalizations or psychiatric interventions other than a recent visit to Mr. T's family physician, Dr. B at which point Mr. T was placed on Lexapro with an unknown dose at this time.  Mr. T is currently seeing Dr. J for psychotherapy where he has been in treatment since April, 2003.,PAST PSYCHIATRIC REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Mr. T denied any history throughout his childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood for depressive, anxiety, or psychotic disorders.  He denied any suicide attempts, or profound suicidal or homicidal ideation.  Mr. T furthermore stated that his family psychiatric history is unremarkable.,SUBSTANCE ABUSE HISTORY:,  Mr. T stated he used alcohol following his divorce in 1993, but has not used it for the last two years.  No other substance abuse was noted.,LEGAL HISTORY: , Currently, charges are pending over the above described incident.,MEDICAL HISTORY: , Mr. T denied any hospitalizations, surgeries, or current medications use for any heart disease, lung disease, liver disease, kidney disease, gastrointestinal disease, neurological disease, closed head injury, endocrine disease, infectious, blood or muscles disease other than stating he has a hiatal hernia and hypercholesterolemia.,PERSONAL AND SOCIAL HISTORY: , Mr. T was born in Dwyne, Missouri, with no complications associated with his birth.  Originally, he was raised by both parents, but they separated at an early age.  When he was about seven years old, he was raised by his mother and stepfather.  He did not sustain a relationship with his biological father from that time on.  He stated his parents moved a lot, and because this many times he was picked on in his new environments, Mr. T stated he was, at times, a rebellious teenager, but he denied any significant inability to socialize, and denied any learning disabilities or the need for special education.,Mr. T stated his stepfather was somewhat verbally abusive, and that he committed suicide when Mr. T was 18 years old.  He graduated from high school and began work at Dana Corporation for two to three years, after which he worked as an energy, auditor for a gas company.  He then became a homemaker while his wife worked for Chrysler for approximately two years.  Mr. T was married for eleven years, and divorced in 1993.  He has a son who is currently 20 years old.  After being a home maker, Mr. T worked for his mother in a restaurant, and moved on from there to work for Borg-Warner corporation for one to two years before beginning at Plum Industries, where he worked for 14 years and worked his way up to lead engineer.,Mental Status Exam:  Mr. T presented with a hyper vigilant appearance, his eye contact was appropriate to the interview, and his motor behavior was tense.  At times he showed some involuntary movements that would be more akin to a resting tremor.  There was no psychomotor retardation, but there was some mild psychomotor excitement.  His speech was clear, concise, but pressured.  His attitude was overly negative and his mood was significant for moderate depression, anxiety, anhedonia and loneliness, and mild evidence of anger.  There was no evidence of euphoria or diurnal mood variation.  His affective expression was restricted range, but there was no evidence of lability.  At times, his affective tone and facial expressions were inappropriate to the interview.  There was no evidence of auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, tactile or visceral hallucinations.  There was no evidence of illusions, depersonalizations, or derealizations.  Mr. T presented with a sequential and goal directed stream of thought.  There was no evidence of incoherence, irrelevance, evasiveness, circumstantiality, loose associations, or concrete thinking.  There was no evidence of delusions; however, there was some ambivalence, guilt, and self-derogatory thoughts.  There was evidence of concreteness for similarities and proverbs.  His intelligence was average.  His concentration was mildly impaired, and there was no evidence of distractibility.  He was oriented to time, place, person and situation.  There was no evidence of clouded consciousness or dissociation.  His memory was intact for immediate, recent, and remote events.,He presented with poor appetite, easily fatigued, and decreased libidinal drive, as well as excessive somnolence.  There was a moderate preoccupation with his physical health pertaining to his headaches.  His judgment was poor for finances, family relations, social relations, employment, and, at this time, he had no future plans.  Mr. T's insight is somewhat moderate as he is aware of his contribution to the problem.  His motivation for getting well is good as he accepts offered treatment, complies with recommended treatment, and seeks effective treatments.  He has a well-developed empathy for others and capacity for affection.,There was no evidence of entitlement, egocentricity, controllingness, intimidation, or manipulation.  His credibility seemed good.  There was no evidence for potential self-injury, suicide, or violence.  The reliability and completeness of information was very good, and there were no barriers to communication.  The information gathered was based on the patient's self-report and objective testing and observation.  His attitude toward the examiner was neutral and his attitude toward the examination process was neutral.  There was no evidence for indices of malingering as there was no marked discrepancy between claimed impairment and objective findings, and there was no lack of cooperation with the evaluation or poor compliance with treatment, and no evidence of antisocial personality disorder.,IMPRESSIONS: , Major Depressive Disorder, single episode,RECOMMENDATIONS AND PLAN: , I recommend Mr. T continue with psychopharmacologic care as well as psychotherapy.  At this time, the excessive amount of psychiatric symptoms would impede Mr. T from seeking employment.  Furthermore, it appears that the primary precipitating event had occurred on March 25, 2003, when Mr. T was fired from his job after being harassed for over a year.  As Mr. T placed his entire identity and sense of survival on his work, this was a deafening blow to his psychological functioning.  Furthermore, it only appears logical that this would precipitate a major depressive episode.",

He denies having any difficulties with his left knee prior to the injury of June 13, 2002.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: , August 2, 2002, MRI of the left knee showed low-grade chondromalacia of the left patellofemoral joint space and a posterior horn tear of the medial meniscus, likely degenerative in nature, and also grade II to III chondromalacia of the medial joint space.  On June 26, 2007, MRI of his left knee was referred to in the injury management report of June 19, 2007, as showing osteoarthritis of the medial compartment has advanced.  He brought with him copies of x-rays taken July 16, 2007, of his left knee, which I reviewed and which showed marked narrowing of the medial compartment of his left knee with spurs on the margins of the joint medially and also spurs on the patella.  There was subluxation of the tibia on the femur with standing.,After his injury, he received treatment from Dr. X for patellofemoral syndrome with knee sleeve.  He also received treatment from Dr. Y also for left knee sprain and patellar pain.  He also did exercise, does use a knee sleeve and Aleve.  On December 5, 2002, he underwent arthroscopy of the left knee by Dr. Z who did a partial resection of a torn medial meniscus.  He also noticed grade III chondromalacia of the patella as well as the torn medial meniscus.  He states that he was asymptomatic until he slipped on an air hose while at work on March 7, 2007, and again developed pain and swelling in his left knee.  Standing aggravates his pain.  He has had one injection of cortisone by Dr. Z about a month ago, which has helped his pain.  He takes one hydrocodone 7.5/750 mg daily.,Examination of his left knee revealed there was bilateral varus deformity, healed arthroscopy incisional scars, there was a 1/2 atrophy of the left calf.  There was patellar crepitus with knee motion.  There was no motor weakness or reflex changes.  He walked without a limp and could stand on his heels and toes equally well.  There was no instability of the knee and no effusion.  Range of motion was 0 to 120 degrees.,QUESTION: , Xxxxx has recently filed to reactivate this claim.  Please give me your opinion as to whether Xxxxx's current clinical presentation is related to the industrial injury stated above.,ANSWER:, Yes.  His original MRI of August 2, 2002, did show low-grade chondromalacia of the patellofemoral joint and also grade II to III chondromalacia of the medial joint space, which was the beginning of osteoarthritis.  Also, it is well known that torn medial meniscus can result in osteoarthritis of the knee; therefore, the osteoarthritis is related to his original injury of June 13, 2007, specifically to the torn medial meniscus.,QUESTION:  ,Do I believe that claim #123 should be reactivated to allow for treatment of the allowed conditions as stated?,ANSWER:, Yes, I believe it should be reactivated to allow treatment of the contested condition of osteoarthritis of his left knee.,QUESTION:,  Xxxxx has filed an application for additional allowance of osteoarthritis of the left knee.  Based on the current objective findings, mechanism of injury, medical records, and diagnostic studies, does the medical evidence support the existence of the requested condition?,ANSWER: ,Yes.  Please see the discussion in the answer to question no one.  In addition, x-rays of July 16, 2007, do reveal medial compartment and patellofemoral compartment osteoarthritis of the left knee.,QUESTION: , If you find this condition exists, is it a direct and proximate result of the June 13, 2002, injury?,ANSWER:, Yes.  See discussion in answer to question number one.,QUESTION: , Do you find that Xxxxx's injury or disability was caused by the natural deterioration of tissue, an organ or part of body?,ANSWER: ,No.  I believe the osteoarthritis was the result of the torn medial meniscus as discussed under question number one.,QUESTION: , In addition, if you find the condition exists, are there non-occupational activities or intervening injuries, which could have contributed to Xxxxx's condition?,ANSWER:, No.  He does not give any history of any intervening injuries.,If you opine the requested condition should be additionally recognized, please include the condition as an allowed condition in the discussion of the following questions.,QUESTION:,  Based on the objective findings is the request for 10 sessions of physical therapy per C-9 dated July 27, 2007, medically necessary and appropriate for the allowed conditions of the claim of osteoarthritis of left knee?,ANSWER:,  Yes.,",

Box 12345,City, State ,RE: EXAMINEE : Abc,CLAIM NUMBER : 12345-67890,DATE OF INJURY : April 20, 2003,DATE OF EXAMINATION : August 26, 2003,EXAMINING PHYSICIANS : Y Z, DC,Prior to the beginning of the examination, it is explained to the examinee that this examination is intended for evaluative purposes only, and that it is not intended to constitute a general medical examination. It is explained to the examinee that the traditional doctor-patient relationship does not apply to this examination, and that a written report will be provided to the agency requesting this examination. It has also been emphasized to the examinee that he should not attempt any physical activity beyond his tolerance, in order to avoid injury.,CHIEF COMPLAINTS: , Improved focal lower back pain.,HISTORY: , Abc is a 26-year-old man who immigrated to this country approximately six years ago. He speaks \"un poquito\" English and an interpreter is provided. He has worked for the last four years at Floragon Forest Products, where he normally functions as a \"stacker.\" He indicates that another worker was on vacation, and because of this he was put on another job in which he separated logs using a picaroon. He was doing this on April 20, 2003, and was pulling on the picaroon when it gave way, and he fell backwards landing on a metal step, which was approximately 1 foot off of the ground. He demonstrates that he came down square on the step and did not fall backwards or hyperextend over it. He did not hit his upper back or neck or shoulders, and only sat down on the step as described. He had \"a little\" pain in his back at that time, but was able to get up and continue working. He completed his shift that day and returned to work the following day. He had the next two days off. He says that his symptoms persisted and increased, and on April 25, 2003, he went to the First Choice Physicians Chiropractic and Rehab Clinic, where he came under the care of Dr. Abcd, DC. The file contains an entrance form completed by Mr. Abc which indicates at the bottom under \"previous occurrence of the same pain\" a notation of \"Yes, but it was not really the same, it was just a little and tolerable.\" There is an additional note on the side which states \"no pain prior to this injury or on that day, occasional (but low back).\" Saw this notation, he says today that he did not state this and that the form was done by \"Edna\" at Dr. Abcd's office.,Mr. Abc was initially treated three times a week and states that this has now been reduced to twice per week. He does not know how long the chiropractic treatment is to continue. Initially, he has been seen by Dr. Xyz on three occasions, the last being on August 15, 2003. Dr. Xyz has basically referred him back to Dr. Abcd for continued chiropractic management.,Mr. Abc has now returned to his normal job as a stacker and is able to do that with no significant increased pain. He does mention, however, that bending over, picking up anything particularly heavy is bothersome; however, he does not normally have to do that. He denies any new accident or injury that would be contributory either as a result of his work or outside activities or any motor vehicle accident. He does not participate physically in any sports or hobbies that would be a factor.,PRESENT COMPLAINTS: , Mr. Abc indicates at this time that he is overall better in that initially he had difficulty \"moving.\" He grades his current overall level of pain as a 2 to 4 on a scale from 0 to 10, stating that the worst he had was at 6-7. He now has \"good and bad days\" which depends on his activity level noting that he is better over the weekend. He localizes his pain to the midline lumbosacral region. He states that initially he did experience some diffuse radiation into both lower extremities, but that this has now resolved. He occasionally will notice some tightness behind both knees, but again no radicular type of distribution. He denies any focal muscular weakness or sphincter disturbance. His quality of the pain at this time is a \"tightness\" which bothers him, again, primarily with bending at the waist and lifting. He is able to do his normal activities of life, including his work without any significant problem, noting again only increased pain with bending and lifting.,PAST HISTORY: , Mr. Abc denies any prior similar complaints or treatments. He denies any previous specific lower back injury. He has enjoyed essentially good lifetime health and denies any concurrent medical conditions or problems. He has seasonal allergies only with no known drug hypersensitivities. He has not been hospitalized overnight and has had no surgeries in his life. He currently takes OTC Advil and Tylenol for lower back pain, but no prescriptive medication. He does not smoke, drink, or use street drugs of any type. Review of systems and family history are generally noncontributory.,SOCIO-ECONOMIC HISTORY: , Mr. Abc, as indicated, was born and reared in Mexico and immigrated into this country six years ago.,Education: He has our equivalent of a high school education in Mexico with no additional formal education in United States.,Military History: He has no military experience in his life.,Work History: He currently is doing his normal work activities as a stacker without arbitrary restrictions or limitations. He is not receiving any Workers Compensation or other benefits at this time.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Abc presents as a cooperative and straightforward 26-year-old Hispanic male. He has a very thin body habitus with a reported height of 5 feet 7 inches and weight of 125 pounds. He is right hand dominant. He is noted to sit comfortably throughout the history taking process conversant with the interpreter and myself without observable guarding or postural conversation or motion. He did stand readily to full upright with equal weightbearing and exhibits normal spinal posture with double hips and shoulders. Lumbar lordosis is normal. He ambulates without a limp or lift, and is able to walk on heels and toes and perform a full squat and rise and hop without difficulty with some expression of increased lower back pain. Waddell's testing is negative on compression and traction with some slight increased lower back pain on passive rotation.,Kemp's maneuver of posterolateral bending has some increased localized lumbosacral pain, but no radiation distally into the buttocks or lower extremities.,Active lumbar ranges of motion with double inclinometer are:,Flexion 70 degrees.,Extension 20 degrees.,Side bending symmetric at 28 degrees.,He complains of lower back pain at the extremes of flexion only. Motion palpation reveals full mobility without any detectable intrasegmental fixation with normal symmetry and alignment.,Tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric at the knees and ankles without sensory loss to pinprick. Babinski's are neutral, and there is no clonus.,Manual muscle testing reveals 5/5 strength at the hips, knees, and ankles without give-way or complaint.,Supine passive straight leg raising is limited by hamstring tightness to 66 degrees bilaterally, but causes no expression of lower back pain or radiation. Cross leg with rotation hip joint motion is full on either side without reported hip or back pain. Hip flexion is symmetric at 130 degrees, again without complaint. Leg lengths appeared visually symmetric. Mid calf girth is 11-1/2 inches bilaterally. Five inches above the knees measured 13 inches right and left. The seated SLR is done to 90 degrees, and he brings his fingertips 2 inches from his toes, showing good flexibility at the waist despite the hamstring tightness noted in the supine straight leg raising test.,In the prone position, he has good gluteal strength on either side with Yeoman's test causing some increased lumbosacral pain but no focal sacroiliac involvement. No sacroiliac fixation is identified. Hibbs test is negative on either side.,On palpation, he reports midline tenderness at L5-S1 without additional areas of tenderness noted even to very firm palpatory pressure in the entirety of the lumbar spine over the pelvis. He indicates no focal or sacroiliac, sciatic notch, or trochanteric tenderness on either side. No definitive muscular spasm is noted in the lumbar paraspinal musculature.,Mr. Abc tolerated the examination process without apparent or expressed ill effect. ,IMAGING STUDIES:,  AP and lateral lumbar/pelvic views dated May 15, 2003 are reviewed. The films are negative for recent fracture or pathology. There appears to be a transitional lumbosacral area with a spatulated transverse process of L1 and slight narrowing of the lumbosacral disc space. No additional abnormalities are identified. The hip and sacroiliac articulations appear well preserved. Disc spacing in the rest of the lumbar spine appears normal, and no significant degenerative changes are identified. Soft tissue appeared normal without paraspinal mass or abnormality.,DIAGNOSIS: , Lumbosacral contusion/strain relative to the April 20, 2003 industrial accident - objectively resolved.,SUMMARY: , Discussion and recommendations in response to questions posed in your August 15, 2003 letter:,1. What is your diagnosis of the worker's condition as a result of the injury? Please provide objective medical findings that support your diagnosis. Please indicate if the objective findings are reproducible, measurable, or observable, and how.,The diagnosis of the workers condition secondary to the described April 20, 2003 fall is by history a lumbosacral contusion/strain. This impression is primarily made based on his history noting that at this time, he has no abnormal objective findings.,2. In your opinion, is the work injury a contributing cause of the diagnosis? If so, is the work injury the material contributing cause of the diagnosis? Please provide an explanation for your opinion.,It would appear that the work injury was the major contributing cause of the diagnosis.,3. Are there any off work factors that may have caused or contributed to the worker's current complaints or condition? (Such as idiopathic causes, predisposition, congenital abnormalities, off work injuries, etc.).",

      "text": "XYZ,RE:  ABC,MEDICAL RECORD#:  123,Dear Dr. XYZ:,I saw ABC back in Neuro-Oncology Clinic today.  He comes in for an urgent visit because of increasing questions about what to do next for his anaplastic astrocytoma.,Within the last several days, he has seen you in clinic and once again discussed whether or not to undergo radiation for his left temporal lesion.  The patient has clearly been extremely ambivalent about this therapy for reasons that are not immediately apparent.  It is clear that his MRI is progressing and that it seems unlikely at this time that anything other than radiation would be particularly effective.  Despite repeatedly emphasizing this; however, the patient still is worried about potential long-term side effects from treatment that frankly seem unwarranted at this particular time.,After seeing you in clinic, he and his friend again wanted to discuss possible changes in the chemotherapy regimen.  They came in with a list of eight possible agents that they would like to be administered within the next two weeks.  They then wanted another MRI to be performed and they were hoping that with the use of this type of approach, they might be able to induce another remission from which he can once again be spared radiation.,From my view, I noticed a man whose language has deteriorated in the week since I last saw him.  This is very worrisome.  Today, for the first time, I felt that there was a definite right facial droop as well.  Therefore, there is no doubt that he is becoming symptomatic from his growing tumor.  It suggests that he is approaching the end of his compliance curve and that the things may rapidly deteriorate in the near future.,Emphasizing this once again, in addition, to recommending steroids I once again tried to convince him to undergo radiation.  Despite an hour, this again amazingly was not possible.  It is not that he does not want treatment, however.  Because I told him that I did not feel it was ethical to just put him on the radical regimen that him and his friend devised, we compromised and elected to go back to Temodar in a low dose daily type regimen.  We would plan on giving 75 mg/sq m everyday for 21 days out of 28 days.  In addition, we will stop thalidomide 100 mg/day.  If he tolerates this for one week, we then agree that we would institute another one of the medications that he listed for us.  At this stage, we are thinking of using Accutane at that point.,While I am very uncomfortable with this type of approach, I think as long as he is going to be monitored closely that we may be able to get away with this for at least a reasonable interval.  In the spirit of compromise, he again consented to be evaluated by radiation and this time, seemed more resigned to the fact that it was going to happen sooner than later.  I will look at this as a positive sign because I think radiation is the one therapy from which he can get a reasonable response in the long term.,I will keep you apprised of followups.  If you have any questions or if I could be of any further assistance, feel free to contact me.,Sincerely,",

The patient was referred for evaluation of cataracts bilaterally.,On examination, the patient was seeing 20/40 in her right eye and 20/50 in the left eye.  Extraocular muscles were intact, visual fields were full to confrontation OU, and applanations are 12 mmHg bilaterally.  There is no relative afferent pupillary defect.  On slit lamp examination, lids and lashes were within normal limits.  The conj is quiet.  The cornea shows 1+ guttata bilaterally.

He is an unfortunate 19-year-old right-handed male who was injured in a motor vehicle accident on MM/DD/YYYY, where he was the driver of an automobile, which was struck on the front passenger's side.  The patient sustained impact injuries to his neck and lower back.  There was no apparent head injury or loss of consciousness and he denied any posttraumatic seizures.  He was taken to Hospital, x-rays were taken, apparently which were negative and he was released.,At the present time, he complains of neck and lower back pain radiating into his right arm and right leg with weakness, numbness, paraesthesia, and tingling in his right arm and right leg.  He has had no difficulty with bowel or bladder function.  He does experience intermittent headaches associated with his neck pain with no other associated symptoms.,PAST HEALTH:,  He was injured in a prior motor vehicle accident on MM/DD/YYYY.  At the time of his most recent injuries, he was completely symptom free and under no active therapy.  There is no history of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, neurological disorders, ulcers or tuberculosis.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , He denies tobacco or alcohol consumption.,ALLERGIES: , No known drug allergies.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  ,None.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Otherwise noncontributory.,FUNCTIONAL INQUIRY: , Otherwise noncontributory.,REVIEW OF DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:,  Includes an MRI scan of the cervical spine dated MM/DD/YYYY which showed evidence for disc bulging at the C6-C7 level.  MRI scan of the lumbar spine on MM/DD/YYYY, showed evidence of a disc herniation at the L1-L2 level as well as a disc protrusion at the L2-L3 level with disc herniations at the L3-L4 and L4-L5 level and disc protrusion at the L5-S1 level.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Reveals an alert and oriented male with normal language function.  Vital Signs:  Blood pressure was 105/68 in the left arm sitting.  Heart rate was 70 and regular.  Height was 5 feet 8 inches.  Weight was 182 pounds.  Cranial nerve evaluation was unremarkable.  Pupils were equal and reactive.  Funduscopic evaluation was clear.  There was no evidence for nystagmus.  There was decreased range of motion noted in both the cervical and lumbar regions to a significant degree, with tenderness and spasm in the paraspinal musculature.  Straight leg raising was limited to 45 degrees on the right and 90 degrees on the left.  Motor strength was 5/5 on the MRC scale.  Reflexes were 2+ symmetrical and active.  No pathological responses were noted.  Sensory examination showed a diffuse decreased sensation to pinprick in the right upper extremity.  Cerebellar function was normal.  There was normal station and gait.  Chest and cardiovascular evaluations were unremarkable.  Heart sounds were normal.  There were no extra sounds or murmurs.  Palpable trigger points were noted in the right trapezius and right cervical and lumbar paraspinal musculature.,CLINICAL IMPRESSION: , Reveals a 19-year-old male suffering from a posttraumatic cervical and lumbar radiculopathy, secondary to traumatic injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident on MM/DD/YYYY.  In view of the persistent radicular complaints associated with the weakness, numbness, paraesthesia, and tingling as well as the objective sensory loss noted on today's evaluation as well as the non-specific nature of the radiculopathy, I have scheduled him for an EMG study on his right upper and right lower extremity in two week's time to rule out any nerve root irritation versus any peripheral nerve entrapment or plexopathy as the cause of his symptoms.  Palpable trigger points were noted on today's evaluation.  He is suffering from ongoing myofascitis.  His treatment plan will consist of a series of trigger point injections to be initiated at his next follow up visit in two weeks' time.  I have encouraged him to continue with his ongoing treatment program under your care and supervision.  I will be following him in two weeks' time.  Once again, thank you kindly for allowing me to participate in this patient's care and management.,Yours sincerely,,",

Right double-J 4.5 x 26 mm ureteral stent placement.,ANESTHESIA: , Sedation.,SPECIMEN: , Urine for cytology and culture sensitivity, right renal pelvis urine for cytology, and right upper pole biopsies.,INDICATION:,  The patient is a 74-year-old male who was initially seen in the office with hematuria.  He was then brought to the hospital for other medical problems and found to still have hematuria.  He has a CAT scan with abnormal appearing right kidney and it was felt that he will benefit from cystoscope evaluation.,PROCEDURE: ,After consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  He was given IV sedation and placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  He was then prepped and draped in the standard fashion.  A #21 French cystoscope was then passed through his ureter on which patient was noted to have a hypospadias and passed through across the ends of the bladder.  The patient was noted to have mildly enlarged prostate, however, it was non-obstructing.,Upon visualization of the bladder, the patient was noted to have some tuberculation to the bladder.  There were no masses or any other abnormalities noted other than the tuberculation.  Attention was then turned to the right ureteral orifice and an open-end of the catheter was then passed into the right ureteral orifice.  A retrograde pyelogram was performed.  Upon visualization, there was no visualization of the upper collecting system on the right side.  At this point, a guidewire was then passed through the open-end of the ureteral catheter and the catheter was removed.  The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed.  The rigid ureteroscope was then passed into the bladder and into the right ureteral orifice with the assistance of a second glidewire.  The ureteroscope was taken all the way through the proximal ureter just below the UPJ and there were noted to be no gross abnormalities.  The ureteroscope was removed and an Amplatz wire then passed through the scope up into the collecting system along the side of the previous wire.  The ureteroscope was removed and a ureteral dilating sheath was passed over the Amplatz wire into the right ureter under fluoroscopic guidance.  The Amplatz wire was then removed and the flexible ureteroscope was passed through the sheath into the ureter.  The ureteroscope was passed up to the UPJ at which point there was noted to be difficulty entering the ureter due to UPJ obstruction.  The wire was then again passed through the flexible scope and the flexible scope was removed.  A balloon dilator was then passed over the wire and the UPJ was dilated with balloon dilation.  The dilator was then removed and again the cystoscope was passed back up into the right ureter and was able to enter the collecting system.  Upon visualization of the collecting system of the upper portion, there was noted to be papillary mass within the collecting system.  The ________ biopsy forceps were then passed through the scope and two biopsies were taken of the papillary mass.  Once this was done, the wire was left in place and the ureteroscope was removed.  The cystoscope was then placed back into the bladder and a 26 x 4.5 mm ureteral stent was passed over the wire under fluoroscopic and cystoscopic guidance into the right renal pelvis.  The stent was noted to be clear within the right renal pelvis as well as in the bladder.  The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He will be transferred to the recovery room and back to his room.  It has been discussed with his primary physician that the patient will likely need a nephrectomy.  He will be scheduled for an echocardiogram tomorrow and then decision will be made where the patient will be stable for possible nephrectomy on Wednesday.",

Although, the patient is right-handed, preoperative vein mapping demonstrated much better vein in the right arm.  Hence, a right brachiocephalic fistula is being planned.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS,The right cephalic vein at the elbow is chosen to be suitable.  It is slightly sporadic, but of an adequate size.  An end-to-side right brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistula was created.  At completion, there was a great thrill.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL,After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  The patient received a regional nerve block.  The patient also received intravenous sedation.  The right arm was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,We made a small transverse incision in the right cubital fossa.  The cephalic vein was identified and mobilized.  The fascia was incised, and the brachial artery was also identified and mobilized.  The brachial artery was free off significant disease.  A good pulse was noted.  The cephalic vein was mobilized proximally and distally.  The brachial artery was mobilized proximally and distally.  We did not give heparin.  The brachial artery was then clamped proximally and distally.  The cephalic vein was also clamped proximally and distally.  Longitudinal arteriotomy was made in brachial artery, and a longitudinal venotomy was made in the cephalic vein.  We then sewn the vein to the artery in a side-to-side fashion using a running 7-0 Prolene suture.,Just prior to completion of the anastomosis, it was flushed, and the anastomosis was then completed.  A great thrill was noted.  We then ligated the cephalic vein beyond the arteriovenous anastomosis and divided it.  This surrounded the anastomosis as an end-to-side functionally.  A great thrill remained in the fistula.  Hemostasis was secured.  We then closed the wound using interrupted PDS sutures for the fascia and a running 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular suture for the skin.  Sterile dry dressing was applied.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no operative complications.  The sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.  I was present and participated in all aspects of the procedure.  The patient was then transferred to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  A great thrill was felt in the fistula completion.  There was also a palpable radial pulse distally.",

Retroperitoneal fibrosis.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:,1.  Laparoscopic lysis of adhesions.,2.  Attempted laparoscopic pyeloplasty.,3.  Open laparoscopic pyeloplasty.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE:  ,This is a 62-year-old female with a history of right ureteropelvic junction obstruction with chronic indwelling double-J ureteral stent.  The patient presents for laparoscopic pyeloplasty.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operative suite and administered general anesthetic.  The patient was sterilely prepped and draped in the supine fashion after building up the right side of the OR table to aid in the patient's positioning for bowel retraction.  Hassan technique was performed for the initial trocar placement in the periumbilical region.  Abdominal insufflation was performed.  There were significant adhesions noted.  A second 12 mm port was placed in the right midclavicular line at the level of the umbilicus and a Harmonic scalpel was placed through this and adhesiolysis was performed for approximately two-and-half hours, also an additional port was placed 12 mm in the midline between the xiphoid process and the umbilicus, an additional 5 mm port in the right upper quadrant subcostal and midclavicular.  After adhesions were taken down, the ascending colon was mobilized by incising the white line of Toldt and mobilizing this medially.  The kidney was able to be palpated within Gerota's fascia.  The psoas muscle caudate to the inferior pole of the kidney was identified and the tissue overlying this was dissected to the level of the ureter.  The uterus was grasped with a Babcock through a trocar port and carried up to the level of the ureteropelvic junction obstruction.  The renal pelvis was also identified and dissected free.  There was significant fibrosis and scar tissue around the ureteropelvic junction obliterating the tissue planes.  We were unable to dissect through this mass of fibrotic tissue safely and therefore the decision was made to abort the laparoscopic procedure and perform the pyeloplasty open.  An incision was made from the right upper quadrant port extending towards the midline.  This was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, anterior fascia, muscle layers, posterior fascia, and peritoneum.  A Bookwalter retractor was placed.  The renal pelvis and the ureter were again identified.  Fibrotic tissue was able to be dissected away at this time utilizing right angle clamps and Bovie cautery.  The tissue was sent down to Pathology for analysis.  Please note that upon entering the abdomen, all of the above which was taken down from the adhesions to the abdominal wall were carefully inspected and no evidence of bowel injury was noted.  Ureter was divided just distal to the ureteropelvic junction obstruction and stent was maintained in place.  The renal pelvis was then opened in a longitudinal manner and excessive pelvis was removed reducing the redundant tissue.  At this point, the indwelling double-J ureteral stent was removed.  At this time, the ureter was spatulated laterally and at the apex of this spatulation a #4-0 Vicryl suture was placed.  This was brought up to the deepened portion of the pyelotomy and cystic structures were approximated.  The back wall of the ureteropelvic anastomosis was then approximated with running #4-0 Vicryl suture.  At this point, a double-J stent was placed with a guidewire down into the bladder.  The anterior wall of the uteropelvic anastomosis was then closed again with a #4-0 running Vicryl suture.  Renal sinus fat was then placed around the anastomosis and sutured in place.  Please note in the inferior pole of the kidney, there was approximately 2 cm laceration which was identified during the dissection of the fibrotic tissue.  This was repaired with horizontal mattress sutures #2-0 Vicryl.  FloSeal was placed over this and the renal capsule was placed over this.  A good hemostasis was noted.  A #10 Blake drain was placed through one of the previous trocar sites and placed into the perirenal space away from the anastomosis.  The initial trocar incision was closed with #0 Vicryl suture.  The abdominal incision was also then closed with running #0 Vicryl suture incorporating all layers of muscle and fascia.  The Scarpa's fascia was then closed with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl suture.  The skin edges were then closed with staples.  Please note that all port sites were inspected prior to closing and hemostasis was noted at all sites and the fascia was noted to be reapproximated as these trocar sites were placed with the ________ obturator.  We placed the patient on IV antibiotics and pain medications.  We will obtain KUB and x-rays for stent placement.  Further recommendations to follow.",

      "text": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 55-year-old gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right leg weakness.  He has difficulty recollecting the exact details and chronology of his problem.  To the best of his recollection, he thinks that about six months ago he developed weakness of his right leg.  He describes that he is reaching to get something from a cabinet and he noticed that he was unable to stand on his right toe.  Since that time, he has had difficulty pushing off when he walks.  He has mild tingling and numbness in his toes, but this has been a chronic problem and nothing new since he has developed the weakness.  He has chronic mild back pain, but this has been persistent for many years and has not changed.  He has experienced cramps in both calves for the past year.  This dissipated about two months ago.  He does not think that his left leg is weak.  He does not have any bowel or bladder incontinence.  There is no radicular pain.  He does not think that the problem is progressive, meaning that the weakness that he perceives in his right leg is no different than when it was six months ago.,He first sought medical attention for this problem in October.  He then saw you a couple of months later.  He has undergone an EMG and nerve conduction studies.  Unfortunately, he cannot undergo an MRI of his spine because he has an ear implant.  He has had a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal.,In addition, the patient has hyperCKemia.  He tells me that he has had an elevated CK prior to starting taking stat medications, although this is not entirely clear to me.  He thinks that he is not taking Lipitor for about 15 months and thought that his CK was in the 500 or 600s prior to starting it.  Once it was started, it increased to about 800 and then came down to about 500 when it was stopped.  He then had a recent bump again up to the 1000 and since Lipitor has been stopped, his CK apparently has returned to about the 500 or 600s.  I do no have any laboratory data to support these statements by the patient, but he seems to be up to speed on this.  More recently, he has been started taking Zetia.  He does not have any proximal weakness.  He denies any myalgias., ,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  He has coronary artery disease and has received five stents.  He has hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.  He states that he was diagnosed with diabetes based on the results of an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test.  He believes that his glucose shot up to over 300 with this testing.  He does not take any medications for this and his blood glucoses are generally normal when he checks it.  He has had plastic surgery on his face from an orbital injury.  He also had an ear graft when he developed an ear infection during his honeymoon., ,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:, He takes amlodipine, Diovan, Zetia, hydrochlorothiazide, Lovaza (fish oil), Niaspan, aspirin, and Chantix.  , ,ALLERGIES:,  He has no known drug allergies., ,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  He lives with his wife.  He works at Shepherd Pratt doing network engineering.  He smokes a pack of cigarettes a day and is working on quitting.  He drinks four alcoholic beverages per night.  Prior to that, he drank significantly more.  He denies illicit drug use.  He was athletic growing up., ,FAMILY HISTORY:,  His mother died of complications from heart disease.  His father died of heart disease in his 40s.  He has two living brothers.  One of them he does not speak too much with and does not know about his medical history.  The other is apparently healthy.  He has one healthy child.  His maternal uncles apparently had polio.  When I asked him to tell me further details about this, he states that one of them had to wear crutches due to severe leg deformans and then the other had leg deformities in only one leg.  He is fairly certain that they had polio.  He is unaware of any other family members with neurological conditions.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , He has occasional tinnitus.  He has difficulty sleeping.

      "text": "XYZ,RE:  ABC,MEDICAL RECORD#:  123,Dear Dr. XYZ:,I saw ABC back in Neuro-Oncology Clinic today.  He comes in for an urgent visit because of increasing questions about what to do next for his anaplastic astrocytoma.,Within the last several days, he has seen you in clinic and once again discussed whether or not to undergo radiation for his left temporal lesion.  The patient has clearly been extremely ambivalent about this therapy for reasons that are not immediately apparent.  It is clear that his MRI is progressing and that it seems unlikely at this time that anything other than radiation would be particularly effective.  Despite repeatedly emphasizing this; however, the patient still is worried about potential long-term side effects from treatment that frankly seem unwarranted at this particular time.,After seeing you in clinic, he and his friend again wanted to discuss possible changes in the chemotherapy regimen.  They came in with a list of eight possible agents that they would like to be administered within the next two weeks.  They then wanted another MRI to be performed and they were hoping that with the use of this type of approach, they might be able to induce another remission from which he can once again be spared radiation.,From my view, I noticed a man whose language has deteriorated in the week since I last saw him.  This is very worrisome.  Today, for the first time, I felt that there was a definite right facial droop as well.  Therefore, there is no doubt that he is becoming symptomatic from his growing tumor.  It suggests that he is approaching the end of his compliance curve and that the things may rapidly deteriorate in the near future.,Emphasizing this once again, in addition, to recommending steroids I once again tried to convince him to undergo radiation.  Despite an hour, this again amazingly was not possible.  It is not that he does not want treatment, however.  Because I told him that I did not feel it was ethical to just put him on the radical regimen that him and his friend devised, we compromised and elected to go back to Temodar in a low dose daily type regimen.  We would plan on giving 75 mg/sq m everyday for 21 days out of 28 days.  In addition, we will stop thalidomide 100 mg/day.  If he tolerates this for one week, we then agree that we would institute another one of the medications that he listed for us.  At this stage, we are thinking of using Accutane at that point.,While I am very uncomfortable with this type of approach, I think as long as he is going to be monitored closely that we may be able to get away with this for at least a reasonable interval.  In the spirit of compromise, he again consented to be evaluated by radiation and this time, seemed more resigned to the fact that it was going to happen sooner than later.  I will look at this as a positive sign because I think radiation is the one therapy from which he can get a reasonable response in the long term.,I will keep you apprised of followups.  If you have any questions or if I could be of any further assistance, feel free to contact me.,Sincerely,",

He is almost 3 years old.  He presented with 2 months of irritability, vomiting, and increasing seizures.  CT scan was not conclusive, but shuntogram shows no flow through the shunt.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table with his head turned to the left.  Scalp was clipped.  He was prepped on the head, neck, chest and abdomen with ChloraPrep.  Incisions were infiltrated with 0.5% Xylocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000.  He received oxacillin.,He was then reprepped and draped in a sterile manner.,The frontal incision was reopened and extended along the valve.  Subcutaneous sharp dissection with Bovie cautery was done to expose the shunt parts.  I separated the ventricular catheter from the valve, and this was a medium pressure small contour Medtronic valve.  There was some flow from the ventricular catheter, but not as much as I would expect.  I removed the right-angled clip with a curette and then pulled out the ventricular catheter, and there was gushing of CSF under high pressure.  So, I do believe that the catheter was obstructed, although inspection of the old catheter holes did not show any specific obstructions.  A new Codman BACTISEAL catheter was placed through the same hole.  I replaced it several times because I wanted to be sure it was in the cavity.  It entered easily and there was still just intermittent flow of CSF.  The catheter irrigated very well and seemed to be patent.,I tested the distal system with an irrigation filled feeding tube, and there was excellent flow through the distal valve and catheter.  So I did not think it was necessary to replace those at this time.  The new catheter was trimmed to a total length of 8 cm and attached to the proximal end of the valve.  The valve connection was secured to the pericranium with a #2-0 Ethibond suture.  The wound was irrigated with bacitracin irrigation.  The shunt pumped and refilled well.  The wound was then closed with #4-0 Vicryl interrupted galeal suture and Steri-Strips on the skin.  It was uncertain whether this will correct the problem or not, but we will continue to evaluate.  If his abdominal pressure is too high, then he may need a different valve.  This will be determined over time, but at this time, the shunt seemed to empty and refill easily.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  No complications.  Sponge and needle counts were correct.  Blood loss was minimal.  None replaced.",

His condition is felt to be critical.  In a desperate attempt to relieve increased intracranial pressure, we have proposed placing a ventriculostomy.  I have discussed this with patient's wife who agrees and asked that we proceed emergently.,After a sterile prep, drape, and shaving of the hair over the left frontal area, this area is infiltrated with local anesthetic.  Subsequently a 1 cm incision was made over Kocher's point.  Hemostasis was obtained.  Then a twist drill was made over this area.  Bones strips were irrigated away.  The dura was perforated with a spinal needle.,A Camino monitor was connected and zeroed.  This was then passed into the left lateral ventricle on the first pass.  Excellent aggressive very bloody CSF under pressure was noted.  This stopped, slowed, and some clots were noted.  This was irrigated and then CSF continued.

Biparietal craniotomy and excision of left parietooccipital metastasis from breast cancer.,2.  Insertion of left lateral ventriculostomy under Stealth stereotactic guidance.,3.  Right suboccipital craniectomy and excision of tumor.,4.  Microtechniques for all the above.,5.  Stealth stereotactic guidance for all of the above and intraoperative ultrasound.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 48-year-old woman with a diagnosis of breast cancer made five years ago.  A year ago, she was diagnosed with cranial metastases and underwent whole brain radiation.  She recently has deteriorated such that she came to my office, unable to ambulate in a wheelchair.  Metastatic workup does reveal multiple bone metastases, but no spinal cord compression.  She had a consult with Radiation-Oncology that decided they could radiate her metastases less than 3 cm with stereotactic radiosurgery, but the lesions greater than 3 cm needed to be removed.  Consequently, this operation is performed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient underwent a planning MRI scan with Stealth protocol.  She was brought to the operating room with fiducial still on her scalp.  General endotracheal anesthesia was obtained.  She was placed on the Mayfield head holder and rolled into the prone position.  She was well padded, secured, and so forth.  The neck was flexed so as to expose the right suboccipital region as well as the left and right parietooccipital regions.  The posterior aspect of the calvarium was shaved and prepared in the usual manner with Betadine soak scrub followed by Betadine paint.  This was done only, of course, after fiducial were registered in planning and an excellent accuracy was obtained with the Stealth system.  Sterile drapes were applied and the accuracy of the system was confirmed.  A biparietal incision was performed.  A linear incision was chosen so as to increase her chances of successful wound healing and that she is status post whole brain radiation.  A biparietal craniotomy was carried out, carrying about 1 cm over toward the right side and about 4 cm over to the left side as guided by the Stealth stereotactic system.  The dura was opened and reflected back to the midline.  An inner hemispheric approach was used to reach the very large metastatic tumor.  This was very delicate removing the tumor and the co-surgeons switched off to spare one another during the more delicate parts of the operation to remove the tumor.  The tumor was wrapped around and included the choroidal vessels.  At least one choroidal vessel was sacrificed in order to obtain a gross total excision of the tumor on the parietal occipital region.  Bleeding was quite vigorous in some of the arteries and finally, however, was completely controlled.  Complete removal of the tumor was confirmed by intraoperative ultrasound.,Once the tumor had been removed and meticulous hemostasis was obtained, this wound was left opened and attention was turned to the right suboccipital area.  A linear incision was made just lateral to the greater occipital nerve.  Sharp dissection was carried down in the subcutaneous tissues and Bovie electrocautery was used to reach the skull.  A burr hole was placed down low using a craniotome.  A craniotomy was turned and then enlarged as a craniectomy to at least 4 cm in diameter.  It was carried caudally to the floor of the posterior fossa and rostrally to the transverse sinus.  Stealth and ultrasound were used to localize the very large tumor that was within the horizontal hemisphere of the cerebellum.  The ventriculostomy had been placed on the left side with the craniotomy and removal of the tumor, and this was draining CSF relieving pressure in the posterior fossa.  Upon opening the craniotomy in the parietal occipital region, the brain was noted to be extremely tight, thus necessitating placement of the ventriculostomy.,At the posterior fossa, a corticectomy was accomplished and the tumor was countered directly.  The tumor, as the one above, was removed, both piecemeal and with intraoperative Cavitron Ultrasonic Aspirator.  A gross total excision of this tumor was obtained as well.,I then explored underneath the cerebellum in hopes of finding another metastasis in the CP angle; however, this was just over the lower cranial nerves, and rather than risk paralysis of pharyngeal muscles and voice as well as possibly hearing loss, this lesion was left alone and to be radiated and that it is less than 3 cm in diameter.,Meticulous hemostasis was obtained for this wound as well.,The posterior fossa wound was then closed in layers.  The dura was closed with interrupted and running mattress of 4-0 Nurolon.  The dura was watertight, and it was covered with blue glue.  Gelfoam was placed over the dural closure.  Then, the muscle and fascia were closed in individual layers using #0 Ethibond.  Subcutaneous was closed with interrupted inverted 2-0 and 0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with running locking 3-0 Nylon.,For the cranial incision, the ventriculostomy was brought out through a separate stab wound.  The bone flap was brought on to the field.  The dura was closed with running and interrupted 4-0 Nurolon.  At the beginning of the case, dural tack-ups had been made and these were still in place.  The sinuses, both the transverse sinus and sagittal sinus, were covered with thrombin-soaked Gelfoam to take care of any small bleeding areas in the sinuses.,Once the dura was closed, the bone flap was returned to the wound and held in place with the Lorenz microplates.  The wound was then closed in layers.  The galea was closed with multiple sutures of interrupted 2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running locking 3-0 Nylon.,Estimated blood loss for the case was more than 1 L.  The patient received 2 units of packed red cells during the case as well as more than 1 L of Hespan and almost 3 L of crystalloid.,Nevertheless, her vitals remained stable throughout the case, and we hopefully helped her survival and her long-term neurologic status for this really nice lady.",

An incision was made over the posterior spinous process of T10, T11, T12, L1, and L2.  A Weitlaner retractor was placed and cutting Bovie current was used to incise the fascia overlying the dorsal spinous process of T10, T11, T12, L1, and L2.  An additional muscular ligamentous attachment was dissected free bilaterally with cutting Bovie current osteotome and Cobb elevator.  The cerebellar retractors were placed in the wound and obvious deformation of the lamina particularly on the left side at T12 was apparent.  Initially, on the patient's left side, pedicle screws were placed in T11 and L1.  The inferior articular facet was removed at T11 and an awl placed at the proximal location of the pedicle.  Placement confirmed with biplanar coaxial fluoroscopy.  The awl was in appropriate location and using a pedicle finder under fluoroscopic control, the pedicle was probed to the mid portion of the body of T11.  A 40-mm Click'X screw, 6.5 mm diameter with rod holder was then threaded into the T11 vertebral body.,Attention was next turned to the L1 level on the left side and the junction of the transverse processes with the superior articular facet and intra-articular process was located using an AM-8 dissecting tool, AM attachment to the Midas Rex instrumentation.  The area was decorticated, an awl was placed, and under fluoroscopic biplanar imaging noted to be at the pedicle in L1.  Using a pedicle probe, the pedicle was then probed to the mid body of L1 and a 7-mm diameter 45-mm in length Click'X Synthes screw with rod holder was placed in the L1 vertebral body.,At this point, an elongated rod was placed on the left side for purposes of distraction should it be felt necessary in view of the MRI findings of significant compression on the patient's ventral canal on the right side.  Attention was next turned to the right side and it should be noted that the dissection above was carried out with operating room microscope and at this point, the intraspinous process ligament superior to the posterior spinous process at T12 was noted be completely disrupted on a traumatic basis.  The anteroposterior spinous process ligament superior to the T12 was incised with cutting Bovie current and the posterior spinous process at T12 removed with a Leksell rongeur.  It was necessary to remove portion of the posterior spinous process at T11 for a full visualization of the involved laminar fractures at T12.,At this point, a laminectomy was performed using 45-degree Kerrison rongeur, both 2 mm and 4 mm, and Leksell rongeur.  There was an epidural hematoma encountered to the midline and left side at the mid portion of the T12 laminectomy and this was extending superiorly to the T11-T12 interlaminar space.  Additionally, there was marked instability of the facets bilaterally at T12 and L1.  These facets were removed with 45-degree Kerrison rongeur and Leksell rongeur.  Bony compression both superiorly and laterally from fractured bony elements was removed with 45-degree Kerrison rongeur until the thecal sac was completely decompressed.  The exiting nerve roots at T11 and T12 were visualized and followed with Frazier dissectors, and these nerve roots were noted to be completely free.  Hemostasis was controlled with bipolar coagulation.,At this point, a Frazier dissector could be passed superiorly, inferiorly, medially, and laterally to the T11-T12 nerve roots bilaterally, and the thecal sac was noted to be decompressed both superiorly and inferiorly, and noted to be quite pulsatile.  A #4 Penfield was then used to probe the floor of the spinal canal, and no significant ventral compression remained on the thecal sac.  Copious antibiotic irrigation was used and at this point on the patient's right side, pedicle screws were placed at T11 and L1 using the technique described for a left-sided pedicle screw placement.  The anatomic landmarks being the transverse process at T11, the inferior articulating facet, and the lateral aspect of the superior articular facet for T11 and at L1, the transverse process, the junction of the intra-articular process and the facet joint.,With the screws placed on the left side, the elongated rod was removed from the patient's right side along with the locking caps, which had been placed.  It was felt that distraction was not necessary.  A 75-mm rod could be placed on the patient's left side with reattachment of the locking screw heads with the rod cap locker in place; however, it was necessary to cut a longer rod for the patient's right side with the screws slightly greater distance apart ultimately settling on a 90-mm rod.  The locking caps were placed on the right side and after all 4 locking caps were placed, the locking cap screws were tied to the cold weld.  Fluoroscopic examination demonstrated no evidence of asymmetry at the intervertebral space at T11-T12 or T12-L1 with excellent positioning of the rods and screws.  A crosslink approximately 60 mm in width was then placed between the right and left rods, and all 4 screws were tightened.,It should be noted that prior to the placement of the rods, the patient's autologous bone, which had been removed during laminectomy portion of the procedure and cleansed off soft tissue and morcellated was packed in the posterolateral space after decortication had been effected on the transverse processes at T11, T12, and L1 with AM-8 dissecting tool, AM attachment as well as the lateral aspects of the facet joints.  This was done bilaterally prior to placement of the rods.,Following placement of the rods as noted above, allograft bone chips were packed in addition on top of the patient's own allograft in these posterolateral gutters.  Gelfoam was used to cover the thecal sac and at this point, the wound was closed by approximating the deep muscle with 0 Vicryl suture.  The fascia was closed with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture, subcutaneous layer was closed with 2-0 Vicryl suture, subcuticular layer was closed with 2-0 inverted interrupted Vicryl suture, and the skin approximated with staples.  The patient appeared to tolerate the procedure well without complications.",

His MRI confirmed significant neurologic compression in the cervical spine, combined with a clinical exam consistent with radiculopathy, myelopathy, and weakness.  We discussed the diagnosis and the treatment options.  Due to the severity of his neurologic symptoms as well as the amount of neurologic compression seen radiographically, I recommended that he proceed with surgical intervention as opposed to standard nonsurgical treatment such as physical therapy, medications, and steroid injections.  I explained the surgery itself which will be to remove pressure from the spinal cord via anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at C3-C4 and C4-C5.  We reviewed the surgery itself as well as risks including infection and blood vessels or nerves, leakage of spinal fluid, weakness or paralysis, failure of the pain to improve, possible worsening of the pain, failure of the neurologic symptoms to improve, possible worsening of the neurologic symptoms, and possible need for further surgery including re-revision and/or removal.  Furthermore I explained that the fusion may not become solid or that the hardware could break.  We discussed various techniques available for obtaining fusion and I recommended allograft and plate fixation.  I explained the rationale for this as well as the options of using his own bone.  Furthermore, I explained that removing motion at the fusion sites will transfer stress to other disc levels possibly accelerating there degeneration and causing additional symptoms and/or necessitating additional surgery in the future.,OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: , After obtaining the appropriate signed and informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room, where he underwent general endotracheal anesthesia without complications.  He was then positioned supine on the operating table, and all bony prominences were padded.  Pulse oximetry was maintained on both feet throughout the case.  The arms were carefully padded and tucked at his sides.  A roll was placed between the shoulder blades.  The areas of the both ears were sterilely prepped and cranial tongs were applied in routine fashion.  Ten pounds of traction was applied.  A needle was taped to the anterior neck and an x-ray was done to determine the appropriate level for the skin incision.  The entire neck was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.,A transverse skin incision was made and carried down to the platysma muscle.  This was then split in line with its fibers.  Blunt dissection was carried down medial to the carotid sheath and lateral to the trachea and esophagus until the anterior cervical spine was visualized.  A needle was placed into a disc and an x-ray was done to determine its location.  The longus colli muscles were then elevated bilaterally with the electrocautery unit.  Self-retaining retractors were placed deep to the longus colli muscle in an effort to avoid injury to the sympathetic chains.,Radical anterior discectomies were performed at C3-C4 and C4-C5.  This included complete removal of the anterior annulus, nucleus, and posterior annulus.  The posterior longitudinal ligament was removed as were the posterior osteophytes.  Foraminotomies were then accomplished bilaterally.  Once all of this was accomplished, the blunt-tip probe was used to check for any residual compression.  The central canal was wide open at each level as were the foramen.,A high-speed bur was used to remove the cartilaginous endplates above and below each interspace.  Bleeding cancellous bone was exposed.  The disc spaces were measured and appropriate size allografts were placed sterilely onto the field.  After further shaping of the grafts with the high-speed bur, they were carefully impacted in to position.  There was good juxtaposition against the bleeding decorticated surfaces and good distraction of each interspace.  All weight was then removed from the crania tongs.,The appropriate size anterior cervical locking plate was chosen and bent into gentle lordosis.  Two screws were then placed into each of the vertebral bodies at C3, C4, and C5.  There was excellent purchase.  A final x-ray was done confirming good position of the hardware and grafts.  The locking screws were then applied, also with excellent purchase.,Following a final copious irrigation, there was good hemostasis and no dural leaks.  The carotid pulse was strong.  A drain was placed deep to the level of the platysma muscle and left at the level of the hardware.  The wounds were then closed in layers using 4-0 Vicryl suture for the platysma muscle, 4-0 Vicryl suture for the subcutaneous tissue, and 4-0 Vicryl suture in a subcuticular skin closure.  Steri-Strips were placed followed by application of a sterile dressing.  The drain was hooked to bulb suction.  A Philadelphia collar was applied.,The cranial tongs were carefully removed.  The soft tissue overlying the puncture site was massaged to free it up from the underlying bone.  There was good hemostasis.,The patient was then carefully returned to the supine position on his hospital bed where he was reversed and extubated and taken to the recovery room having tolerated the procedure well.",

Biopsy was obtained and revealed squamous carcinoma.  The lesion extended slightly above the hymeneal ring and because of vaginal involvement was classified as a T3/Nx/Mx on clinical examination.  Of note, past history is significant for pelvic radiation for cervical cancer many years previously.,FINDINGS: , The examination under anesthesia revealed a 1.5 cm nodule of disease extending slightly above the hymeneal ring.  There was no palpable lymphadenopathy in either inguinal node region.  There were no other nodules, ulcerations, or other lesions.  At the completion of the procedure there was no clinical evidence of residual disease.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the Operating Room with an IV in place.  She was placed in the low anterior lithotomy position after adequate anesthesia had been induced.  Examination under anesthesia was performed with findings as noted, after which she was prepped and draped.  The femoral triangles were marked and a 10 cm skin incision was made parallel to the inguinal ligament approximately 3 cm below the ligament.  Camper's fascia was divided and skin flaps were elevated with sharp dissection and ligation of vessels where necessary.  The lymph node bundles were mobilized by incising the loose areolar tissue attachments to the fascia of the rectus abdominis.  The fascia around the sartorius muscle was divided and the specimen was reflected from lateral to medial.  The cribriform fascia was isolated and dissected with preservation of the femoral nerve.  The femoral sheath containing artery and vein was opened and vessels were stripped of their lymphatic attachments.  The medial lymph node bundle was isolated, and Cloquet's node was clamped, divided, and ligated bilaterally.  The saphenous vessels were identified and preserved bilaterally.  The inferior margin of the specimen was ligated, divided, and removed.  Inguinal node sites were irrigated and excellent hemostasis was noted.  Jackson-Pratt drains were placed and Camper's fascia was approximated with simple interrupted stitches.  The skin was closed with running subcuticular stitches using 4-0 Monocryl suture.,Attention was turned to the radical vulvectomy specimen.  A marking pen was used to outline the margins of resection allowing 15-20 mm of margin on the inferior, lateral, and anterior margins.  The medial margin extended into the vagina and was approximately 5-8 mm.  The skin was incised and underlying adipose tissue was divided with electrocautery.  Vascular bundles were isolated, divided, and ligated.  After removal of the specimen, additional margin was obtained from the right vaginal side wall adjacent to the tumor site.  Margins were submitted on the right posterior, middle, and anterior vaginal side walls.  After removal of the vaginal margins, the perineum was irrigated with four liters of normal saline and deep tissues were approximated with simple interrupted stitches of 2-0 Vicryl suture.  The skin was closed with interrupted horizontal mattress stitches using 3-0 Vicryl suture.  The final sponge, needle, and instrument counts were correct at the completion of the procedure.  The patient was then awakened from her anesthetic and taken to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.",

The pain has started in the umbilical area and radiated to McBurney's point.  The patient appears to have a significant pain requiring surgical evaluation.  It did not appear that the pain was pelvic in nature, but more higher up in the abdomen, more towards the appendix.  The patient was seen by Dr. Y at my request in the ER with me in attendance.  We went over the case.  He decided that she should go to the operating room for evaluation and to have appendix evaluated and probably removed.  The patient on ultrasound had a 0.9 cm ovarian cyst on the right side.  The patient's cyst was not completely simple and they are concerns over the possibility of an abnormality.  The patient states that she has had chlamydia in the past, but it was not a pelvic infection more vaginal infection.  The patient has had hospitalization for this.  The patient therefore signed informed in layman's terms with her understanding that perceivable risks and complications, the alternative treatment, the procedure itself and recovery.  All questions were answered.  ,PROCEDURE: ,The patient was seen in the Emergency Room.  In the Emergency Room, there is really no apparent vaginal discharge.  No odor or cervical motion tenderness.  Negative bladder sweep.  Adnexa were without abnormalities.  In the OR, we were able to perform pelvic examination showing a slightly enlarged fibroid uterus about 9 to 10-week size.  The patient had no adnexal fullness.  The patient then underwent an insertion of a uterine manipulator and Dr. X was in the case at that time and he started the laparoscopic process i.e., inserting the laparoscope.  We then observed under direct laparoscopic visualization with the aid of a camera that there was pus in and around the uterus.  The both fallopian tubes were seen.  There did not appear to be hydrosalpinx.  The ovaries were seen.  The left showed some adhesions into the ovarian fossa.  The cul-de-sac had a banded adhesions.  The patient on the right adnexa had a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst, where the cyst was only about a centimeter enlarged.  The ovary did not appear to have pus in it, but there was pus over the area of the bladder flap.  The patient's bowel was otherwise unremarkable.  The liver contained evidence of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome and prior PID.  The appendix was somewhat adherent into the retrocecal area and to the mid-quadrant abdominal sidewall on the right.  The case was then turned over to Dr. Y who was in the room at that time and Dr. X had left.  The patient's case was turned over to him.  Dr. Y was performed an appendectomy following which cultures and copious irrigation.  Dr. Y was then closed the case.  The patient was placed on antibiotics.  We await the results of the cultures and as well further ______ therapy.,PRIMARY DIAGNOSES:,1.  Periappendicitis.,2.  Pelvic inflammatory disease.,3.  Chronic adhesive disease.",

The hymen was found to be intact.  Laparoscopic findings revealed a 4 cm left adnexal mass, which appeared fluid filled.  There were a few calcifications on the surface of the mass.  The right ovary and fallopian tube appeared normal.  There was no evidence of endometriosis.  The uterus appeared normal in size.  There were no pelvic adhesions noted.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 55-year-old gravida 0, para 0 Caucasian female who presents with a left adnexal mass on ultrasound which is 5.3 cm.  She does complain of minimal discomfort.  Bimanual exam was not able to be performed secondary to the vaginal stenosis and completely intact hymen.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken back to the Operative Suite, prepped and draped, and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  A 1 cm skin incision was made in the infraumbilical vault.  While tenting up the abdominal wall, the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty and the abdomen was insufflated.  This was done using appropriate flow and volume of CO2.  The #11 step trocar was then placed without difficulty.  The above findings were confirmed.  A #12 mm port was then placed approximately 2 cm above the pubic symphysis under direct visualization.  Two additional ports were placed, one on the left lateral aspect of the abdominal wall and one on the right lateral aspect of the abdominal wall.  Both #12 step ports were done under direct visualization.  Using a grasper, the mass was tented up at the inferior pelvic ligament and the LigaSure was placed across this and several bites were taken with good visualization while ligating.  The left ovary was then placed in an Endocatch bag and removed through the suprapubic incision.  The skin was extended around this incision and the fascia was extended using the Mayo scissors.  The specimen was removed intact in the Endocatch bag through this site.  Prior to desufflation of the abdomen, the site where the left adnexa was removed was visualized to be hemostatic.  All the port sites were hemostatic as well.  The fascia of the suprapubic incision was then repaired using a running #0 Vicryl stitch on a UR6 needle.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  The remaining incisions were also closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a running fashion after all instruments were removed and the abdomen was completely desufflated.  Steri-Strips were placed on each of the incisions.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle count were x2.  She will go home on Vicodin for pain and followup postoperatively in the office where we will review path report with her.",

The patient was elected to have a left modified radical mastectomy, she was not interested in a partial mastectomy.  She is aware of the risks and complications of surgery, and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room.  She underwent general endotracheal anesthetic.  The TED stockings and venous compression devices were placed on both lower extremities and they were functioning well.  The patient's left anterior chest wall, neck, axilla, and left arm were prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The recent biopsy site was located in the upper and outer quadrant of left breast.  The plain incision was marked along the skin.  Tissues and the flaps were injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine solution and then a transverse elliptical incision was made in the breast of the skin to include nipple areolar complex as well as the recent biopsy site.  The flaps were raised superiorly and just below the clavicle medially to the sternum, laterally towards the latissimus dorsi, rectus abdominus fascia.  Following this, the breast tissue along with the pectoralis major fascia were dissected off the pectoralis major muscle.  The dissection was started medially and extended laterally towards the left axilla.  The breast was removed and then the axillary contents were dissected out.  Left axillary vein and artery were identified and preserved as well as the lung _____.  The patient had several clinically palpable lymph nodes, they were removed with the axillary dissection.  Care was taken to avoid injury to any of the above mentioned neurovascular structures.  After the tissues were irrigated, we made sure there were no signs of bleeding.  Hemostasis had been achieved with Hemoclips.  Hemovac drains x2 were then brought in and placed under the left axilla as well as in the superior and inferior breast flaps.  The subcu was then approximated with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl sutures and skin with clips.  The drains were sutured to the chest wall with 3-0 nylon sutures.  Dressing was applied and the procedure was completed.  The patient went to the recovery room in stable condition.",

I also informed the patient of potential side effects or reactions to the medications potentially used during the procedure including sedatives, narcotics, nonionic contrast agents, anesthetics, and corticosteroids.,The patient was informed both verbally and in writing.  The patient understood the informed consent and desired to have the procedure performed.,PROCEDURE:  ,Oxygen saturation and vital signs were monitored continuously throughout the procedure.  The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback.  The X-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine.,The patient was placed in the prone position on the treatment table, pillow under the chest, and head rotated contralateral to the side being treated.  The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine.  The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement.  Fluoroscopic pillar view was used to identify the bony landmarks of the sacrum and sacroiliac joint and the planned needle approach.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine.,With fluoroscopy, a 25-gauge 3.5-inch spinal needle was gently guided into the groove between the SAP and sacrum through the dorsal ramus of the L5 and the lateral and superior border of the posterior sacral foramen with the lateral branches of S1, S2, and S3.

Intraoperative SSEP and EMG monitoring used.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE: , This lady presented with history of cervical pain associated with cervical radiculopathy with cervical and left arm pain, numbness, weakness, with MRI showing significant disk protrusions with the associate complexes at C5-C6 and C6-C7 with associated cervical radiculopathy.  After failure of conservative treatment, this patient elected to undergo surgery.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the OR and after adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, she was placed supine on the OR table with the head of the bed about 10 degrees.  A shoulder roll was placed and the head supported on a donut support.  The cervical region was prepped and draped in the standard fashion.  A transverse cervical incision was made from the midline, which was lateral to the medial edge of the sternocleidomastoid two fingerbreadths above the right clavicle.  In a transverse fashion, the incision was taken down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and through the platysmata and a subplatysmal dissection done.  Then, the dissection continued medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and then medial to the carotid artery to the prevertebral fascia, which was gently dissected and released superiorly and inferiorly.  Spinal needles were placed into the displaced C5-C6 and C6-C7 to confirm these disk levels using lateral fluoroscopy.  Following this, monopolar coagulation was used to dissect the medial edge of the longus colli muscles off the adjacent vertebrae between C5-C7 and then the Trimline retractors were placed to retract the longus colli muscles laterally and blunt retractors were placed superiorly and inferiorly.  A #15 scalpel was used to do a discectomy at C5-C6 from endplate-to-endplate and uncovertebral joint.  On the uncovertebral joint, a pituitary rongeur was used to empty out any disk material ____________ to further remove the disk material down to the posterior aspect.  This was done under the microscope.  A high-speed drill under the microscope was used to drill down the endplates to the posterior aspect of the annulus.  A blunt trocar was passed underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament and it was gently released using the #15 scalpel and then Kerrison punches 1-mm and then 2-mm were used to decompress further disk calcified material at the C5-C6 level.  This was done bilaterally to allow good decompression of the thecal sac and adjacent neuroforamen.  Then, at the C6-C7 level, in a similar fashion, #15 blade was used to do a discectomy from uncovertebral joint to uncovertebral joint and from endplate-to-endplate using a #15 scalpel to enter the disk space and then the curette was then used to remove the disk calcified material in the endplate, and then high-speed drill under the microscope was used to drill down the disk space down to the posterior aspect of the annulus where a blunt trocar was passed underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament which was gently released.  Then using the Kerrison punches, we used 1-mm and 2-mm, to remove disk calcified material, which was extending more posteriorly to the left and the right.  This was gently removed and decompressed to allow good decompression of the thecal sac and adjacent nerve roots.  With this done, the wound was irrigated.  Hemostasis was ensured with bipolar coagulation.  Vertebral body distraction pins were then placed to the vertebral body of C5 and C7 for vertebral distraction and then a 6-mm allograft performed grafts were taken and packed in either aspect with demineralized bone matrix and this was tapped in flush with the vertebral bodies above and below C5-C6 and C6-C7 discectomy sites.  Then, the vertebral body distraction pins were gently removed to allow for graft seating and compression and then the anterior cervical plate (Danek windows titanium plates) was then taken and sized and placed.  A temporary pin was initially used to align the plate and then keeping the position and then two screw holes were drilled in the vertebral body of C5, two in the vertebral body of C6, and two in the vertebral body of C7.  The holes were then drilled and after this self-tapping screws were placed into the vertebral body of C5, C6, and C7 across the plate to allow the plate to fit and stay flush with the vertebral body between C5, C6, and C7.  With this done, operative fluoroscopy was used to check good alignment of the graft, screw, and plate, and then the wound was irrigated.  Hemostasis was ensured with bipolar coagulation and then the locking screws were tightened down.  A #10 round Jackson-Pratt drain was placed into the prevertebral space and brought out from a separate stab wound skin incision site.  Then, the platysma was approximated using 2-0 Vicryl inverted interrupted stitches and the skin closed with 4-0 Vicryl running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.  The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure.  Throughout the procedure, the microscope had been used for the disk decompression and high-speed drilling.  In addition, intraoperative SSEP, EMG monitoring, and motor-evoked potentials remained stable throughout the procedure.  The patient remained stable throughout the procedure.",

Anchoring of the intrathecal catheter and connecting of the right lower quadrant SynchroMed pump catheter to the intrathecal catheter.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , Under general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was placed in a lateral decubitus position.  The patient was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  The intrathecal catheter was placed via a percutaneous approach by the pain management specialist at which point an incision was made adjacent to the needle containing the intrathecal catheter.  This incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the paraspinous muscle fascia which was cleared around the entry point of the intrathecal catheter needle.  A pursestring suture of 3-0 Prolene was placed around the needle in the paraspinous muscle.  The needle was withdrawn.  The pursestring suture was tied to snug the tissues around the catheter and prevent cerebrospinal fluid leak.  The catheter demonstrated free flow of cerebrospinal fluid,throughout the RV procedure.  The catheter was anchored to the paraspinous muscle with an anchoring device using interrupted sutures of 3-0 Prolene.  Antibiotic irrigation and antibiotic soak sponge were placed into the wound, and the catheter was clamped to prevent persistent leakage of cerebrospinal fluid while the SynchroMed-pump pocket was created.  Then, I turned my attention to the anterior abdominal wall where an oblique incision was made and carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the external oblique fascia, which was freed from attachments to the overlying subcutaneous tissue utilizing blunt and sharp dissection with electrocautery.  A pocket was created that would encompass the SynchroMed fusion pump.  A tunneling device was then passed through the subcutaneous tissue from the back incision to the abdominal incision, and a SynchroMed pump catheter was placed to the tunneling device.  The tunneling device was then removed leaving the SynchroMed pump catheter extending from the anterior abdominal wall incision to the posterior back incision.  The intrathecal catheter was trimmed.  A clear plastic boot was placed over the intrathecal catheter, and the connecting device was advanced from the SynchroMed pump catheter into the intrathecal catheter connecting the 2 catheters together.  The clear plastic boot was then placed over the connection, and it was anchored in place with 0-silk ties.  Good CSF was then demonstrated flowing through the SynchroMed pump catheter.  The SynchroMed pump catheter was connected to the SynchroMed pump and anchored in place with a 0-silk tie.  Excess catheter was coiled and placed behind the pump.  The pump was placed into the subcutaneous pocket created for it on the anterior abdominal wall.  The pump was anchored to the anterior abdominal wall fascia with interrupted sutures of 2-0 Prolene; 4 of the sutures were placed.  The subcutaneous tissues were irrigated with normal saline.  The subcutaneous tissue of both wounds was closed with running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin of both wounds was closed with staples.  Antibiotic ointment and a sterile dressing were applied.  The patient was awake and taken to the recovery room.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was stable at the completion of the procedure.  All sponge and lap, needle and instrument counts were correct at the completion of the procedure.",

      "text": "DIAGNOSES:,1.  Cervical dystonia.,2.  Post cervical laminectomy pain syndrome.,Ms. XYZ states that the pain has now shifted to the left side.  She has noticed a marked improvement on the right side, which was subject to a botulinum toxin injection about two weeks ago.  She did not have any side effects on the Botox injection and she feels that her activities of daily living are increased, but she is still on the oxycodone and methadone.  The patient's husband confirms the fact that she is doing a lot better, that she is more active, but there are still issues yet regarding anxiety, depression, and frustration regarding the pain in her neck.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  The patient is appropriate.  She is well dressed and oriented x3.  She still smells of some cigarette smoke.  Examination of the neck shows excellent reduction in muscle spasm on the right paraspinals, trapezius and splenius capitis muscles.  There are no trigger points felt and her range of motion of the neck is still somewhat guarded, but much improved.  On the left side, however, there is significant muscle spasm with tight bands involving the multifidus muscle with trigger point activity and a lot of tenderness and guarding.  This extends down into the trapezius muscle, but the splenius capitis seems to be not involved.,TREATMENT PLAN:,  After a long discussion with the patient and the husband, we have decided to go ahead and do botulinum toxin injection into the left multifidus/trapezius muscles.  A total of 400 units of Botox is anticipated.  The procedure is being scheduled.  The patient's medications are refilled.  She will continue to see Dr. Berry and continue her therapy with Mary Hotchkinson in Victoria.",

      "text": "REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , Thyroid mass diagnosed as papillary carcinoma.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a 16-year-old young lady, who was referred from the Pediatric Endocrinology Department by Dr. X for evaluation and surgical recommendations regarding treatment of a mass in her thyroid, which has now been proven to be papillary carcinoma on fine needle aspiration biopsy.  The patient's parents relayed that they first noted a relatively small but noticeable mass in the middle portion of her thyroid gland about 2004.  An ultrasound examination had reportedly been done in the past and the mass is being observed.  When it began to enlarge recently, she was referred to the Pediatric Endocrinology Department and had an evaluation there.  The patient was referred for fine needle aspiration and the reports recently returned a diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma.  The patient has not had any hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, or any symptoms of endocrine dysfunction.  She has no weight changes consistent with either hyper or hypothyroidism.  There is no family history of thyroid cancer in her family.  She has no notable discomfort with this lesion.  There have been no skin changes.  Historically, she does not have a history of any prior head and neck radiation or treatment of any unusual endocrinopathy.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Essentially unremarkable.  The patient has never been hospitalized in the past for any major illnesses.  She has had no prior surgical procedures.,IMMUNIZATIONS: , Current and up to date.,ALLERGIES: , She has no known drug allergies.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  ,Currently taking no routine medications.  She describes her pain level currently as zero.,FAMILY HISTORY: , There is no significant family history, although the patient's father does note that his mother had a thyroid surgery at some point in life, but it was not known whether this was for cancer, but he suspects it might have been for goiter.  This was done in Tijuana.  His mom is from central portion of Mexico.  There is no family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,The patient is a junior at Hoover High School.  She lives with her mom in Fresno.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , A careful 12-system review was completely normal except for the problems related to the thyroid mass.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient is a 55.7 kg, nondysmorphic, quiet, and perhaps slightly apprehensive young lady, who was in no acute distress.  She was alert and oriented x3 and had an appropriate affect.,HEENT:  The head and neck examination is most significant.  There is mild amount of facial acne.  The patient's head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat appeared to be grossly normal.,NECK:  There is a slightly visible midline bulge in the region of the thyroid isthmus.  A firm nodule is present there, and there is also some nodularity in the right lobe of the thyroid.  This mass is relatively hard, slightly fixed, but not tethered to surrounding tissues, skin, or muscles that I can determine.  There are some shotty adenopathy in the area.  No supraclavicular nodes were noted.,CHEST:  Excursions are symmetric with good air entry.,LUNGS:  Clear.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Normal.  There is no tachycardia or murmur noted.,ABDOMEN:  Benign.,EXTREMITIES:  Extremities are anatomically correct with full range of motion.,GENITOURINARY:  External genitourinary exam was deferred at this time and can be performed later during anesthesia.  This is same as too for her rectal examination.,SKIN:  There is no acute rash, purpura, or petechiae.,NEUROLOGIC:  Normal and no focal deficits.  Her voice is strong and clear.  There is no evidence of dysphonia or vocal cord malfunction.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: , I reviewed laboratory data from the Diagnostics Lab, which included a mild abnormality in the AST at 11, which is slightly lower than the normal range.  T4 and TSH levels were recorded as normal.  Free thyroxine was normal, and the serum pregnancy test was negative.  There was no level of thyroglobulin recorded on this.  A urinalysis and comprehensive metabolic panel was unremarkable.  A chest x-ray was obtained, which I personally reviewed.  There is a diffuse pattern of tiny nodules in both lungs typical of miliary metastatic disease that is often seen in patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma.,IMPRESSION/PLAN: , The patient is a 16-year-old young lady with a history of thyroid mass that is now biopsy proven as papillary.  The pattern of miliary metastatic lesions in the chest is consistent with this diagnosis and is unfortunate in that it generally means a more advanced stage of disease.  I spent approximately 30 minutes with the patient and her family today discussing the surgical aspects of the treatment of this disease.  During this time, we talked about performing a total thyroidectomy to eradicate as much of the native thyroid tissue and remove the primary source of the cancer in anticipation of radioactive iodine therapy.  We talked about sentinel node dissection, and we spent significant amount of time talking about the possibility of hypoparathyroidism if all four of the parathyroid glands were damaged during this operation.  We also discussed the recurrent laryngeal and external laryngeal branches of the nerve supplying the vocal cord function and how they cane be damaged during the thyroidectomy as well.  I answered as many of the family's questions as they could mount during this stressful time with this recent information supplied to them.  I also did talk to them about the chest x-ray pattern, which was complete __________ as the film was just on the day prior to my clinic visit.  This will have some impact on the postoperative adjunctive therapy.  The radiologist commented about the risk of pulmonary fibrosis and the use of radioactive iodine in this situation, but it seems likely that is going to be necessary to attempt to treat this disease in the patient's case.  I did discuss with them the possibility of having to take large doses of calcium and vitamin D in the event of hypoparathyroidism if that does happen, and we also talked about possibly sparing parathyroid tissue and reimplanting it in a muscle belly either in the neck or forearm if that becomes a necessity.  All of the family's questions have been answered.  This is a very anxious and anxiety provoking time in the family.  I have made every effort to get the patient under schedule within the next 48 hours to have this operation done.  We are tentatively planning on proceeding this upcoming Friday afternoon with total thyroidectomy.",

I explained to the parents that the possible risks include:  irritation of the nasal mucosa, which can be associated with some bleeding; risk of contamination of the lower airways by passage of the scope in the nasopharynx; respiratory depression from sedation; and a very small risk of pneumothorax.  A bronchoalveolar lavage may be obtained by injecting normal saline in one of the bronchi and suctioning the fluid back.  The sample will then be sent for testing.  The flexible bronchoscopy is mainly diagnostic, any therapeutic intervention, if deemed necessary, will be planned and will require a separate procedure.,The parents seem to understand, had the opportunity to ask questions and were satisfied with the information.

The patient has a history of chronic ulceration to the right foot which has been treated on an outpatient basis with conservative methods Dr. X.  At this time, he desires surgical correction as the ulcer has been refractory to conservative treatment.  Incidentally, the ulcer is noninfective and practically healed at this date.  The consent is available on the chart for review and Dr. X has discussed the risks versus benefits of this procedure to the patient in detail.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room, placed on the operating table in supine position and a safety strap was placed across his waist for his protection.  A pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied about the right foot over copious amount of Webril for the patient's protection.  After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 10 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine plain were administered into the right fifth metatarsal using a Mayo type block technique.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered in the operating field and a sterile stockinet was reflected.  The Betadine was cleansed with saline-soaked gauze and dried.  Anesthesia was tested with a one tooth pickup and found to be adequate.  A #10 blade was used to make 3.5 cm linear incision over the fifth metatarsophalangeal joint.  A #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous layer.  Care was taken to retract the extensor digitorum longus tendon medially and the abductor digiti minimi tendon laterally.  Using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, the medial and lateral edges of the wound were undermined down to the level of the capsule and deep fascia.  A linear capsular incision was made with a #15 blade down to the bone.  The capsular periosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a #15 blade.  Metatarsal head was delivered into the wound.  There was hypertrophic exostosis noted laterally as well as a large bursa in the subcuteneous tissue layer.  The ulcer on the skin was approximately 2 x 2 mm, it was partial skin thickness and did not probe.  A sagittal saw was used to resect the hypertrophic lateral eminence.  The hypertrophic bone was split in half and one half was sent to Pathology and the other half was sent to Microbiology for culture and sensitivity.  Next, a reciprocating rasp was used to smoothen all bony surfaces.  The bone stock had an excellent healthy appearance and did not appear to be infected.  Copious amount of sterile gentamicin impregnated saline were used to flush the wound.  The capsuloperiosteal tissues were reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl in simple interrupted technique.  The subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in simple interrupted technique.  Next, the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon in a horizontal mattress suture technique.  A standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of Betadine-soaked Owen silk, 4x4s, Kerlix, and Kling.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted at the digits.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  He was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot.  He was given a postop shoe and will be full weightbearing.  He has prescription already at home for hydrocodone and does not need to refill.  He is to follow up with Dr. X and was given emergency contact numbers.  He was discharged in stable condition.",

Partial metatarsectomy, right foot.,HISTORY:  ,This 41-year-old Caucasian female who presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint.  The patient states that she has extreme pain over the navicular bone with shoe gear as well as history of multiple osteochondromas of unknown origin.  She states that she has been diagnosed with hereditary osteochondromas.  She has had previous dissection of osteochondromas in the past and currently has not been diagnosed in her feet as well as spine and back.  The patient desires surgical treatment at this time.,PROCEDURE:  ,An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed on the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 5 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected in the diamond block type fashion around the navicular bone as well as the fifth metatarsal.  Foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.,Foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered as well as the operating table.  The sterile stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  Attention was then directed to the navicular region on the right foot.  The area was palpated until the bony prominence was noted.  A curvilinear incision was made over the area of bony prominence.  At that time, a total of 10 cc with addition of 1% additional lidocaine plain was injected into the surgical site.  The incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  The dissection was carried down to the level of the capsule and periosteum.  A linear incision was made over the navicular bone obliquely from proximal dorsal to distal plantar over the navicular bone.  The periosteum and the capsule were then reflected from the navicular bone at this time.  A bony prominence was noted both medially and plantarly to the navicular bone.  An osteotome and mallet were then used to resect the enlarged portion of the navicular bone.  After resection with an osteotome there was noted to be a large plantar shelf.  The surrounding soft tissues were then freed from this plantar area.  Care was taken to protect the attachments of the posterior tibial tendon as much as possible.  Only minimal resection of its attachment to the fiber was performed in order to expose the bone.  Sagittal saw was then used to resect the remaining plantar medial prominent bone.  The area was then smoothed with reciprocating rasp until no sharp edges were noted.  The area was flushed with copious amount of sterile saline at which time there was noted to be a palpable ________ where the previous bony prominence had been noted.  The area was then again flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline and the capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissues were then reapproximated with #4-0 Vicryl to reduce tension from the incision and running #5-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch was performed.,Attention was then directed to the fifth metatarsal.  There was noted to be a palpable bony prominence dorsally with fifth metatarsal head as well as radiographic evidence laterally of an osteochondroma at the neck of the fifth metatarsal.  Approximately 7 cm incision was made dorsolaterally over the fifth metatarsal.  The incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  Care was taken to preserve the extensor tendon.  The incision was then created over the capsule and periosteum of the fifth metatarsal head.  Capsule and periosteum were reflected both dorsally, laterally, and plantarly.  At that time, there was noted to be a visible osteochondroma on the plantar lateral aspect of the fifth metatarsal neck as well as on the dorsal aspect of the head of the fifth metatarsal.  A sagittal saw was used to resect both of these osteal prominences.,All remaining sharp edges were then smoothed with reciprocating rasp.  The area was inspected for the remaining bony prominences and none was noted.  The area was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  Subcutaneous closure was then performed with #4-0 Vicryl in order to reduce tension around the incision line.  Running #5-0 subcutaneous stitch was then performed.  Steri-Strips were applied to both surgical sites.  Dressings consisted of Adaptic, soaked in Betadine, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and the hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the right foot.,The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transferred to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  The patient was given postoperative pain prescription and instructed to be partially weightbearing with crutches as tolerated.  The patient is to follow-up with Dr. X in his office as directed or sooner if any problems or questions arise.",

The patient has been NPO since mid night.  Consent is signed and in the chart.  No known drug allergies.,Details Of Procedure:  An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with a safety belt across the stomach.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed on the left ankle followed by blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 10 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected into the surgical site both medially and laterally across the plantar fascia.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was applied for exsanguination and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was then reflected on the operating, stockinet reflected, and the foot cleansed with a wet and dry sponge.  Attention was then directed to the plantar medial aspect of the left heel.  An approximately 0.75 cm incision was then created in the plantar fat pad over the area of maximal tenderness.,The incision was then deepened with a combination of sharp and blunt dissection until the plantar fascia was palpated.  A #15 blade was then used to transect the medial and central bands of the plantar fascia.  Care was taken to preserve the lateral fibroids.  The foot was dorsiflexed against resistance as the fibers were released and there was noted to be increased laxity after release of the fibers on the plantar aspect of the foot indicating that plantar fascia has in fact been transacted.  The air was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The skin incision was then closed with #3-0 nylon in simple interrupted fashion.  Dressings consisted of #0-1 silk, 4 x 4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted throughout all digits of the left foot.  The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transported to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the left foot.  Intraoperatively, an additional 80 cc of 1% lidocaine was injected for additional anesthesia in the case.  The patient is to be nonweightbearing on the left lower extremity with crutches.

      "text": "REASON FOR REFERRAL: , Ms. A is a 60-year-old African-American female with 12 years of education who was referred for neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X after she demonstrated mild cognitive deficits on a neuropsychological screening evaluation during a followup appointment with him for stroke in July.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:,  Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with Ms. A.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM:,  Ms. A presented to the ABC Hospital emergency department on 07/26/2009 reporting that after she had woken up that morning she noticed numbness and weakness in her left hand, slurred speech, and left facial droop.  Neurological evaluation with Dr. X confirmed left hemiparesis.  Brain CT showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect and that she received TPA and had moderate improvement in left-sided weakness.  These symptoms were thought to be due to a right middle cerebral artery stroke.  She was transferred to the ICU for monitoring.  Ultrasound of the carotids showed 20% to 30% stenosis of the right ICA and 0% to 19% stenosis of the left ICA.  On 07/29/2009, she was admitted for acute inpatient rehabilitation for the treatment of residual functional deficits of her acute ischemic right MCA/CVA.  At discharge on 08/06/2009, she was mainly on supervision for all ADLs and walking with a rolling walker, but tolerating increased ambulation with a cane.  She was discharged home with recommendations for outpatient physical therapy.  She returned to the Sinai ER on 08/2009/2009 due to reported left arm pain, numbness, and weakness, which lasted 10 to 15 minutes and she reported that it felt \"just like the stroke.\"  Brain CT on 08/2009/2009 was read as showing \"mild chronic microvascular ischemic change of deep white matter,\" but no acute or significant interval change compared to her previous scan.  Neurological examination with Dr. Y was within normal limits, but she was admitted for a more extensive workup.  Due to left arm pain an ultrasound was completed on her left upper extremity, but it did not show deep vein thrombosis.,Followup CT on 08/10/2009 showed no significant interval change.  MRI could not be completed due to the patient's weight.  She was discharged on 08/11/2009 in stable condition after it was determined that this event was not neurological in origin; however, note that Ms. A referred to this as a second stroke.,Ms. A presented for a followup outpatient neurological evaluation with Dr. X on 09/22/2009, at which time a brief neuropsychological screening was also conducted.  She demonstrated significant impairments in confrontation naming, abstract verbal reasoning, and visual and verbal memory and thus a more comprehensive evaluation was suggested due to her intent to return to her full-time work duty.  During the current interview, Ms. A reported that she noticed mild memory problems including some difficultly remembering conversations, events, and at times forgetting to take her medications.  She also reported mild difficulty finding words in conversation, solving novel problems and tasks (e.g. difficulty learning to use her camcorder), but overall denied significant cognitive deficits in attention, concentration, language or other areas of cognitive functioning.  When asked about her return to work, she said that she was still on light duty due to limited physical activity because of residual left leg weakness.  She reported that no one had indicated to her that she appeared less capable of performing her job duties, but said that she was also receiving fewer files to process and enter data into the computer at the Social Security Agency that she works at.  Note also that she had some difficulty explaining exactly what her job involved.

      "text": "REASON FOR REFERRAL:,  The patient is a 58-year-old African-American right-handed female with 16 years of education who was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X. She is presenting for a second opinion following a recent neuropsychological evaluation that was ordered by her former place of employment that suggested that she was in the \"early stages of a likely dementia\" and was thereafter terminated from her position as a psychiatric nurse.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.  Note that this evaluation was undertaken as a clinical exam and intended for the purposes of aiding with treatment planning.  The patient was fully informed about the nature of this evaluation and intended use of the results.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  ,Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM:,  The patient reported that she had worked as a nurse supervisor for Hospital Center for four years.  She was dismissed from this position in September 2009, although she said that she is still under active status technically, but is not able to work.  She continues to receive some compensation through FMLA hours.  She said that she was told that she had three options, to resign, to apply for disability retirement, and she had 90 days to complete the process of disability retirement after which her employers would file for charges in order for her to be dismissed from State Services.  She said that these 90 days are up around the end of November.  She said the reason for her dismissal was performance complaints.  She said that they began \"as soon as she arrived and that these were initially related to problems with her taking too much sick time off secondary to diabetes and fibromyalgia management and at one point she needed to obtain a doctor's note for any days off.  She said that her paperwork was often late and that she received discipline for not disciplining her staff frequently enough for tardiness or missed workdays.  She described it as a very chaotic and hectic work environment in which she was often putting in extra time.  She said that since September 2008 she only took two sick days and was never late to work, but that she continued to receive a lot of negative feedback.,In July of this year, she reportedly received a letter from personnel indicating that she was being referred to a state medical doctor because she was unable to perform her job duties and due to excessive sick time.  Following a brief evaluation with this doctor whose records we do not have, she was sent to a neuropsychologist, Dr. Y, Ph.D.  He completed a Comprehensive Independent Medical Evaluation on 08/14/2009.  She said that on 08/27/2009, she returned to see the original doctor who told her that based on that evaluation she was not able to work anymore.  Please note that we do not have copies of any of her work-related correspondence.  The patient never received a copy of the neuropsychological evaluation because she was told that it was \"too derogatory.\"  A copy of that evaluation was provided directly to this examiner for the purpose of this evaluation.  To summarize, the results indicated \"diagnostically, The patient presents cognitive deficits involving visual working memory, executive functioning, and motor functioning along with low average intellectual functioning that is significantly below her memory functioning and below expectation based on her occupational and academic history.  This suggests that her intellectual functioning has declined.\"  It concluded that \"results overall suggest early stages of a likely dementia or possibly the effects of diabetes, although her deficits are greater than expected for diabetes-related executive functioning problems and peripheral neuropathy\u2026  The patient' deficits within the current test battery suggest that she would not be able to safely and effectively perform the duties of a nurse supervisor without help handling documentary demands and some supervision of her visual processing.  The prognosis for improvement is not good, although she might try stimulant medication if compatible with her other.  Following her dismissal, The patient presented to her primary physician, Henry Fein, M.D., who referred her to Dr. X for a second opinion regarding her cognitive deficits.  His neurological examination on 09/23/2009 was unremarkable.  The patient scored 20/30 on the Mini-Mental Status Exam missing one out of three words on recall, but was able to do so with prompting.  A repeat neurocognitive testing was suggested in order to assess for subtle deficits in memory and concentration that were not appreciated on this gross cognitive measure.,IMAGING STUDIES: , MRI of the brain on 09/14/2009 was unremarkable with no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality or abnormal enhancing lesions.  Note that the MRI was done with and without gadolinium contrast.,CURRENT FUNCTIONING:  ,The patient reported that she had experienced some difficulty completing paperwork on time due primarily to the chaoticness of the work environment and the excessive amount of responsibility that was placed upon her.  When asked about changes in cognitive functioning, she denied noticing any decline in problem solving, language, or nonverbal skills.  She also denied any problems with attention and concentration or forgetfulness or memory problems.  She continues to independently perform all activities of daily living.  She is in charge of the household finances, has had no problems paying bills on time, has had no difficulties with driving or accidents, denied any missed appointments and said that no one has provided feedback to her that they have noticed any changes in her cognitive functioning.  She reported that if her children had noticed anything they definitely would have brought it to her attention.  She said that she does not currently have a lawyer and does not intend to return to her previous physician.  She said she has not yet proceeded with the application for disability retirement because she was told that her doctors would have to fill out that paperwork, but they have not claimed that she is disabled and so she is waiting for the doctors at her former workplace to initiate the application.  Other current symptoms include excessive fatigue.  She reported that she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991, but generally symptoms are under better control now, but she still has difficulty secondary to fibromyalgia.  She also reported having fallen approximately five times within the past year.  She said that this typically occurs when she is climbing up steps and is usually related to her right foot \"like dragging.\"  Dr. X's physical examination revealed no appreciable focal peripheral deficits on motor or sensory testing and notes that perhaps these falls are associated with some stiffness and pain of her right hip and knee, which are chronic symptoms from her fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis.  She said that she occasionally bumps into objects, but denied noticing it happening one on any particular part of her body.  Muscle pain secondary to fibromyalgia reportedly occurs in her neck and shoulders down both arms and in her left hip.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: , The patient reported that her birth and development were normal.  She denied any significant medical conditions during childhood.  As mentioned, she now has a history of fibromyalgia.  She also experiences some restriction in the range of motion with her right arm.  MRI of the C-spine 04/02/2009 showed a hemangioma versus degenerative changes at C7 vertebral body and bulging annulus with small central disc protrusion at C6-C7.  MRI of the right shoulder on 06/04/2009 showed small partial tear of the distal infraspinatus tendon and prominent tendinopathy of the distal supraspinatus tendon.  As mentioned, she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991.  She thought that this may actually represent early symptoms of fibromyalgia and said that symptoms are currently under control.  She also has diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, tension headaches, GERD, carpal tunnel disease, cholecystectomy in 1976, and ectopic pregnancy in 1974.  Her previous neuropsychological evaluation referred to an outpatient left neck cystectomy in 2007.  She has some difficulty falling asleep, but currently typically obtains approximately seven to eight hours of sleep per night.  She did report some sleep disruption secondary to unusual dreams and thought that she talked to herself and could sometimes hear herself talking in her sleep.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  NovoLog, insulin pump, metformin, metoprolol, amlodipine, Topamax, Lortab, tramadol, amitriptyline, calcium plus vitamin D, fluoxetine, pantoprazole, Naprosyn, fluticasone propionate, and vitamin C.,SUBSTANCE USE: , The patient reported that she rarely drinks alcohol and she denied smoking or using illicit drugs.  She drinks two to four cups of coffee per day.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,The patient was born and raised in North Carolina.  She was the sixth of nine siblings.  Her father was a chef.  He completed third grade and died at 60 due to complications of diabetes.  Her mother is 93 years old.  Her last job was as a janitor.  She completed fourth grade.  She reported that she has no cognitive problems at this time.  Family medical history is significant for diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, thyroid problems, sarcoidosis, and possible multiple sclerosis and depression.  The patient completed a Bachelor of Science in Nursing through State University in 1979.  She denied any history of problems in school such as learning disabilities, attentional problems, difficulty learning to read, failed grades, special help in school or behavioral problems.  She was married for two years.  Her ex-husband died in 1980 from acute pancreatitis secondary to alcohol abuse.  She has two children ages 43 and 30.  Her son whose age is 30 lives nearby and is in consistent contact with her and she is also in frequent contact and has a close relationship with her daughter who lives in New York.  In school, the patient reported obtaining primarily A's and B's.  She said that her strongest subject was math while her worst was spelling, although she reported that her grades were still quite good in spelling.  The patient worked for Hospital Center for four years.  Prior to that, she worked for an outpatient mental health center for 2-1/2 years.  She was reportedly either terminated or laid off and was unsure of the reason for that.  Prior to that, she worked for Walter P. Carter Center reportedly for 21 years.  She has also worked as an OB nurse in the past.  She reported that other than the two instances reported above, she had never been terminated or fired from a job.  In her spare time, the patient enjoys reading, participating in women's groups doing puzzles, playing computer games.,PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , The patient reported that she sought psychotherapy on and off between 1991 and 1997 secondary to her chronic fatigue.  She was also taking Prozac during that time.  She then began taking Prozac again when she started working at secondary to stress with the work situation.  She reported a chronic history of mild sadness or depression, which was relatively stable.  When asked about her current psychological experience, she said that she was somewhat sad, but not dwelling on things.  She denied any history of suicidal ideation or homicidal ideation.,TASKS ADMINISTERED:,Clinical Interview,Adult History Questionnaire,Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR),Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE),Cognistat Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination,Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; Form XX),Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, 2nd Edition (DRS-2),Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV),Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI),Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA),Auditory Consonant Trigrams (ACT),Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT),Ruff 2 & 7 Selective Attention Test,Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT),Multilingual Aphasia Examination, Second Edition (MAE-II), Token Test, Sentence Repetition, Visual Naming, Controlled Oral Word Association, Spelling Test, Aural Comprehension, Reading Comprehension,Boston Naming Test, Second Edition (BNT-2),Animal Naming Test",

After adequate IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl the procedure was begun.,The lumbar sacral regions were prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine prep and four sterile towels.,The facets in the lumbar regions were visualized with Fluoroscopy using an anterior posterior view.  A skin wheal was placed with 1% Lidocaine at the L34 facet region on the left.  Under fluoroscopic guidance a 22 gauge spinal needle was then placed into the L34 facet on the left side.  This was performed using the oblique view under fluoroscopy to the enable the view of the \"Scotty Dog,\" After obtaining the \"Scotty Dog\" view the joints were easily seen.  Negative aspiration was carefully performed to verity that there was no venous, arterial or cerebral spinal fluid flow.  After negative aspiration was verified, 1/8th of a cc of Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected.  Negative aspiration was again performed and 1/2 cc of solution (Solution consisting of 9 cc of 0.5% Marcaine with 1 cc of Triamcinolone) was then injected into the joint.  The needle was then withdrawn out of the joint and 1.5 cc of this same solution was injected around the joint.  The 22-gauge needle was then removed.  Pressure was place over the puncture site for approximately one minute.  This exact same procedure was then repeated along the left-sided facets at L45, and L5S1.  This exact same procedure was then repeated on the right side.  At each level, vigilance was carried out during the aspiration of the needle to verify negative flow of blood or cerebral spinal fluid.,The patient was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any complications.,Interpretation of the radiograph revealed placement of the 22-gauge spinal needles into the left-sided and right-sided facet joints at, L34, L45, and L5S1.  Visualizing the \"Scotty Dog\" technique under fluoroscopy facilitated this.  Dye spread into each joint space is visualized.  No venous or arterial run-off is noted.  No epidural run-off is noted.  The joints were noted to have chronic inflammatory changes noted characteristic of facet arthrosis.",

The patient states that her husband has been diagnosed with high blood cholesterol as well.  She wants some support with some dietary recommendations to assist both of them in healthier eating.  The two of them live alone now, and she is used to cooking for large portions.  She is having a hard time adjusting to preparing food for the two of them.  She would like to do less food preparation, in fact.  She is starting a new job this week.,OBJECTIVE:,  Her reported height is 5 feet 4 inches.  Today\u2019s weight was 170 pounds.  BMI is approximately 29.  A diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on a 1200 calorie meal plan emphasizing low-saturated fat sources with moderate amounts of sodium as well.  Information on fast food eating was supplied, and additional information on low-fat eating was also supplied.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient\u2019s basal energy expenditure is estimated at 1361 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirement for weight maintenance is estimated at 1759 calories a day.  Her diet history reflects that she is making some very healthy food choices on a regular basis.  She does emphasize a lot of fruits and vegetables, trying to get a fruit or a vegetable or both at most meals.  She also is emphasizing lower fat selections.  Her physical activity level is moderate at this time.  She is currently walking for 20 minutes four or five days out of the week but at a very moderate pace with a friend.  We reviewed the efforts at weight reduction identifying 3500 calories in a pound of body fat and the need to gradually and slowly chip away at this number on a long-term basis for weight reduction.  We discussed the need to reduce calories from what her current patterns are and to hopefully increase physical activity slightly as well.  We discussed menu selection, as well as food preparation techniques.  The patient appears to have been influenced by the current low-carb, high-protein craze and had really limited her food selections based on that.  I was able to give her some more room for variety including some moderate portions of potatoes, pasta and even on occasion breading her meat as long as she prepares it in a low-fat fashion which was discussed.,PLAN:,  Recommend the patient increase the intensity and the duration of her physical activity with a goal of 30 minutes five days a week working at a brisk walk.  Recommend the patient reduce calories by 500 daily to support a weight loss of one pound a week.  This translates into a 1200-calorie meal plan.  I encouraged the patient to keep food records in order to better track calories consumed.  I recommended low fat selections and especially those that are lower in saturated fats.  Emphasis would be placed on moderating portions of meat and having more moderate snacks between meals as well.  This was a one-hour consultation.  I provided my name and number should additional needs arise.",

The patient was readmitted to ABC Hospital on 12/05/08 and was found to have massive swelling in the brain and a second surgery was performed to reduce the swelling.  The patient remained at the acute rehab at ABC until she was discharged home on 01/05/09.  The patient did receive skilled speech therapy while in the acute rehab, which focused on higher level cognitive and linguistic skills such as attention, memory, mental flexibility, and improvement of her executive function.  The patient also complains of difficulty with word retrieval and slurring of speech.  The patient denies any difficulty with swallowing at this time.,OBJECTIVE:  ,Portions of the cognitive linguistic quick test was administered.  An oral mechanism exam was performed.  A motor speech protocol was completed.,The cognitive linguistic subtests of recalling personal facts, symbol cancellation, confrontational naming, clock drawing, story retelling, generative naming, design and memory, and completion of mazes was administered.,The patient was 100% accurate with recalling personal facts, completion of the symbol cancellation tasks, and with confrontational naming.  She had no difficulty with the clock drawing task; however, she has considerable hand tremors, which makes writing difficult.  In the storytelling task, she scored within normal limits.  She was also within normal limits for generative naming.  She did have difficulty with the design, memory, and mazes subtests.  She was unable to complete the second maze during the allotted time.

The patient's sister-in-law was present throughout this assessment and provided all the patient's previous medical history.  Based on the sister-in-law's report, the patient had a stroke on 09/19/08.  The patient spent 6 weeks at XY Medical Center, where she was subsequently transferred to XYZ for therapy for approximately 3 weeks.  ABCD brought the patient to home the Monday before Thanksgiving, because they were not satisfied with the care the patient was receiving at a skilled nursing facility in Tucson.  The patient's previous medical history includes a long history of illegal drug use to include cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, and marijuana.  In March of 2008, the patient had some type of potassium issue and she was hospitalized at that time.  Prior to the stroke, the patient was not working and ABCD reported that she believes the patient completed the ninth grade, but she did not graduate from high school.  During the case history, I did pose several questions to the patient, but her response was often \"no.\"  She was very emotional during this evaluation and crying occurred multiple times.,OBJECTIVE:  ,To evaluate the patient's overall communication ability, a Western Aphasia Battery was completed.  Also tests were not done due to time constraint and the patient's severe difficulty and emotional state.  Speech automatic tests were also completed to determine if the patient had any functional speech.,ASSESSMENT:,  Based on the results of the Weston aphasia battery, the patient's deficits most closely resemble global aphasia.  On the spontaneous speech subtest, the patient responded \"no\" to all questions asked except for how are you today where she gave a thumbs-up.  She provided no responses to picture description task and it is unclear if the patient was unable to follow the direction or if she was unable to see the picture clearly.  The patient's sister-in-law did state that the patient wore glasses, but she currently does not have them and she did not know the extent the patient's visual deficit.,On the auditory verbal comprehension portion of the Western Aphasia Battery, the patient answered \"no\" to all \"yes/no\" questions.  The auditory word recognition subtest, the patient had 5 out of 60 responses correct.  With the sequential command, she had 10 out of 80 corrects.  She was able to shut her eyes, point to the window, and point to the pen after directions.  With repetition subtest, she repeated bed correctly, but no other stimuli.  At this time, the patient became very emotional and repeatedly stated \"I can't\".  During the naming subtest of the Western Aphasia Battery, the patient's responses contained numerous paraphasias and her speech was often unintelligible due to jargon.  The word fluency test was not administered and the patient scored 2 out of 10 on the sentence completion task and 0 out of 10 on the responsive speech.  In regards to speech automatics, the patient is able to count from 1 to 9 accurately; however, stated 7 instead of 10 at the end of the task.  She is not able to state the days of the week or months in the year or her name at this time.  She cannot identify the day on calendar and was unable to verbally state the date or month.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  ,The patient's communication deficits most closely resemble global aphasia where she has difficulty with both receptive as well as expressive communication.  She does perseverate and is very emotional due to probable frustration.  Outpatient skilled speech therapy is recommended to improve the patient's functional communication skills.,PATIENT GOAL: , Her sister-in-law stated that they would like to improve upon the patient's speech to allow her to communicate more easily at home.,PLAN OF CARE: , Outpatient skilled speech therapy two times a week for the next 12 weeks.  Therapy to include aphasia treatment and home activities.,SHORT-TERM GOALS (8 WEEKS):,1.  The patient will answer simple \"yes/no\" questions with greater than 90% accuracy with minimal cueing.,2.  The patient will be able to complete speech automatic tasks with greater than 80% accuracy without models or cueing.,3.  The patient will be able to complete simple sentence completion and/or phrase completion with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.,4.  The patient will be able to follow simple one-step commands with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.,5.  The patient will be able to name 10 basic everyday objects with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.,SHORT-TERM GOALS (12 WEEKS):,  Functional communication abilities to allow the patient to express her basic wants and needs.",

The head was placed on a well-padded head holder.  The eyes and face were protected from pressure.  A well-padded roll was placed beneath the neck and shoulders to help preserve the cervical lordosis.  The arms were tucked and draped to the sides.  All bony prominences were well padded.  An x-ray was taken to confirm the correct level of the skin incision.  The anterior neck was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,A straight transverse skin incision over the left side of the anterior neck was made and carried down sharply through the skin and subcutaneous tissues to the level of the platysma muscle, which was divided transversely using the electrocautery.  The superficial and deep layers of the deep cervical fascia were divided.  The midline structures were reflected to the right side.  Care was taken during the dissection to avoid injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the usual anatomical location of that nerve was protected.  The carotid sheath was palpated and protected laterally.  An x-ray was taken to confirm the level of C5-C6 and C6-C7.,The longus colli muscle was dissected free bilaterally from C5 to C7 using blunt dissection.  Hemostasis was obtained using the electrocautery.  The blades of the cervical retractor were placed deep to the longus colli muscles bilaterally.  At C5-C6, the anterior longitudinal ligament was divided transversely.  Straight pituitary rongeurs and a curette were used to remove the contents of the disc space.  All cartilages were scraped off the inferior endplate of C5 and from the superior endplate of C6.  The disc resection was carried posteriorly to the posterior longitudinal ligament and laterally to the uncovertebral joints.  The posterior longitudinal ligament was resected using a 1 mm Kerrison rongeur.  Beginning in the midline and extending into both neural foramen, posterior osteophytes were removed using a 1 m and a 2 mm Kerrison rongeurs.  The patient was noted to have significant bony spondylosis causing canal and foraminal stenosis as well as a degenerative and protruding disc in agreement with preoperative diagnostic imaging studies.  Following completion of the discectomy and osteophytectomy, a blunt nerve hook was passed into the canal superiorly and inferiorly as well as in the both neural foramen to make sure that there were no extruded disc fragments and to make sure the bony decompression was complete.  A portion of the uncovertebral joint was resected bilaterally for additional nerve root decompression.  Both nerve roots were visualized and noted to be free of encroachment.  The same procedure was then carried out at C6-C7 with similar findings.  The only difference in the findings was that at C6-C7 on the left side, the patient was found to have an extruded disc fragment in the canal and extending into the left side neural foramen causing significant cord and nerve root encroachment.,In preparation for the arthrodesis, the endplates of C5, C6, and C7 were burred in a parallel fashion down to the level of bleeding bone using a high-speed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling.  The disc spaces were then measured to the nearest millimeter.  Attention was then turned toward preparation of the structural allograft, which consisted of two pieces of pre-machined corticocancellous bone.  The grafts were further shaped to fit the disc spaces exactly in a press-fit manner with approximately 1.5 mm of distraction at each disc space.  The grafts were shaped to be slightly lordotic to help preserve the cervical lordosis.  The grafts were impacted into the disc spaces.  There was complete bony apposition between the ends of the bone grafts and the vertebral bodies of C5, C6, and C7.  A blunt nerve hook was passed posterior to each bone graft to make sure that the bone grafts were in good position.  Anterior osteophytes were removed using a high-speed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling.  An appropriate length Synthes cervical plate was selected and bent slightly to conform to the patient's cervical lordosis.  The plate was held in the midline with provided instrumentation while a temporary fixation screw was applied at C6.  Screw holes were then drilled using the provided drill and drill guide taking care to avoid injury to neurovascular structures.  The plate was then rigidly fixed to the anterior spine using 14-mm cancellous screws followed by locking setscrews added to the head of each screw to prevent postoperative loosening of the plate and/or screws.,An x-ray was taken, which confirmed satisfactory postioning of the plate, screws, and bone grafts.,Blood loss was minimal.  The wound was irrigated with irrigant solution containing antibiotics.  The wound was inspected and judged to be dry.  The wound was closed over a suction drain placed in the deepest portion of the wound by reapproximating the platysma muscle with #4-0 Vicryl running suture, the subdermal and subcuticular layers with #4-0 Monocryl interrupted sutures, and the skin with Steri-Strips.  The sponge and needle count were correct.  A sterile dressing was applied to the wound.  The neck was placed in a cervical orthosis.  The patient tolerated the procedure and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.",

The procedure was discussed with the patient and the patient opted for laparoscopic repair due to multiple attempts at the open inguinal repair on the right.  The patient also is requesting circumcision with phimosis at the same operating time setting.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient was found to have a right inguinal hernia with omentum and bowel within the hernia, which was easily reduced.  The patient was also found to have a phimosis, which was easily removed.,PROCEDURE:,  After informed consent, the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient.  The patient was brought to operating suite, after general endotracheal intubation, prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  An infraumbilical incision was made with a #15 Bard-Parker scalpel.  The umbilical skin was elevated with a towel clip and the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty.  Saline drop test proved entrance into the abdominal cavity and then the abdomen was insufflated to sufficient pressure of 15 mmHg.  Next, the Veress was removed and #10 bladed trocar was inserted without difficulty.  The 30-degree camera laparoscope was then inserted and the abdomen was explored.  There was evidence of a large right inguinal hernia, which had omentum as well as bowel within it, easily reducible.  Attention was next made to placing a #12 port in the right upper quadrant, four fingerbreadths from the umbilicus.  Again, a skin was made with a #15 blade scalpel and the #12 port was inserted under direct visualization.  A #5 port was inserted in the left upper quadrant in similar fashion without difficulty under direct visualization.  Next, a grasper with blunt dissector was used to reduce the hernia and withdraw the sac and using an Endoshears, the peritoneum was scored towards the midline and towards the medial umbilical ligament and lateral.  The peritoneum was then spread using the blunt dissector, opening up and identifying the iliopubic tract, which was identified without difficulty.  Dissection was carried out, freeing up the hernia sac from the peritoneum.  This was done without difficulty reducing the hernia in its entirety.  Attention was next made to placing a piece of Prolene mesh, it was placed through the #12 port and placed into the desired position, stapled into place in its medial aspect via the 4 mm staples along the iliopubic tract.  The 4.8 mm staples were then used to staple the superior edge of the mesh just below the peritoneum and then the patient was re-peritonealized, re-approximating edge of the perineum with the 4.8 mm staples.  This was done without difficulty.  All three ports were removed under direct visualization.  No evidence of bleeding and the #10 and #12 mm ports were closed with #0-Vicryl and UR6 needle.  Skin was closed with running subcuticular #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.  Attention was next made to carrying out the circumcision.  The foreskin was retracted back over the penis head.  The desired amount of removing foreskin was marked out with a skin marker.  The foreskin was then put on tension using a clamp to protect the penis head.  A #15 blade scalpel was used to remove the foreskin and sending off as specimen.  This was done without difficulty.  Next, the remaining edges were retracted, hemostasis was obtained with Bovie electrocautery and the skin edges were re-approximated with #2-0 plain gut in simple interrupted fashion and circumferentially.  This was done without difficulty maintaining hemostasis.,A petroleum jelly was applied with a Coban dressing.  The patient tolerated this procedure well and was well and was transferred to recovery after extubation in stable condition.",

General endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 4-0 silk suture is used as a stay-stitch of the glans penis.  Next, incision line was marked circumferentially on the outer skin 3 mm below the corona.  The incision was then carried through the skin and subcutaneous tissues down to within a layer of * fascia.  Next, the foreskin was retracted.  Another circumferential incision was made 3 mm proximal to the corona.  The intervening foreskin was excised.  Meticulous hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  Next, the skin was reapproximated at the frenulum with a U stitch of 5-0 chromic followed by stitches at 12, 3, and 9 o'clock.  The stitches were placed equal distance among these to reapproximate all the skin edges.  Next, good cosmetic result was noted with no bleeding at the end of the procedure.  Vaseline gauze, Telfa, and Elastoplast dressing was applied.  The stay-stitch was removed and pressure held until bleeding stopped.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was returned to the recovery room in stable condition.",
